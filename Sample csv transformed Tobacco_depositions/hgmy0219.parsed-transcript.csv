question,answer,Declarative_Text
"Miss Bonhomme, good morning.","Good morning, Mr. Bigger."
It's nice to see you again.,Same. Same here.
"We said hello we said hello off the record, but for the record, hello. I know you've had your deposition taken before. But just by way of reminder, we have to try not to talk over each other. If you don't understand any of the questions that I'm asking, please let me know, and I'll rephrase. You know, I need actual answers rather than head nods, all that sort of thing. I know you're familiar with all that.",Yes.
Okay. You understand why we're here today?,Yes.
So you are the designee on behalf of Philip Morris USA to speak to certain issues in the Lourie case which is pending in Tampa?,"That's my understanding, yes."
Okay. And the general issues that have been defined by the court for today's deposition are those related to youth smoking and youth marketing. Is that also your understanding?,"That's my understanding, yes."
"Okay. I'm not going to I actually don't have a copy, to be quite honest, to mark for the record, but you've seen a copy of the Notice of Taking your Depositions in this case?",Yes.
"And obviously it said to be here today, and you're here today?",Yes.
Have you also seen something called a Verified Worksheet or a Defendant's Verified Worksheet?,No.
You've never seen that?,"No. 4 Q. Okay. Well, I won't go I won't go over the details. But yeah, since you haven't seen it, I'm now just not going to spend time going over that right A Q Okay? Okay. j But as we said, you do understand you're here today to speak for Philip Morris and give its position on various issues related to youth smoking and j youth A Q marketing? Yes, I understand that. ji Okay. All right."
What I'm. handing you right now is what we've previously marked as PT6142.,
"So, Miss Bonhomme, your attorney, Mr. Geraghty, has handed you a copy of what we've marked as PT6142. Do you see that document?","Yes, I do."
"And just for your reference, the PT numbers are our Exhibit Numbers. They should be down on the bottom right-hand corner of most of these documents.",
"So if I'm talking about a PT something, that's usually where the number is going to be. You'll find it on the first page at least.",Okay. Thank you.
"And so what I've handed you is a letter that is from February 14th, 1952.",Yes.
"And it is written to a Ms. Gladys Dickey in Encino, California?","That's correct, yes."
And the author of this letter is a gentleman named W.F. Greenwald.,Yes. j
"Are you familiar with Mr. Greenwald, or I guess maybe it was Dr. Greenwald?",I'm not familiar with him. I see that he's : a research director that worked at Philip Morris. i
And you,I did not know him. This goes back to I I
I understand.,-- about the time I was born. i
Fair qualification.,Okay. jj
"I'm not asking And you know all my questions today, and it's kind of tricky because you're, you know, obviously you're Miss Bonhomme, but you're the designee for Philip Morris.",Yes. j
"And I'll ask bad questions from time to time. But usually when I'm asking about you, I'm going |; to be referring to the company because you're speaking for the company. That was just a bad question, period.",Okay. j
But Mr. Greenwald was the research director for Philip Morris?,"He was a research director. That's my I understanding, yes. i"
Okay. In the 1950s and I think also the 1940s?,It's my understanding in the 1950s. I don't : know about the 19 40s. :
"And this letter that he's writing to Miss Dickey is acknowledging a letter she had sent to, you know, Philip Morris or perhaps to him? Yes. All right. I believe she sent it to Philip Morris. Okay. And so in response to Miss Dickey Well, let me ask you this. Have you seen the letter that she wrote to him? Q- letter I did. \ You do have a copy of that? Not with me, but... ; Okay. And you don't have a copy of that with you today? N o . I All right. Was that letter I know you guys had sent some documents over. I didn't remember seeing",Yes.
Okay. When did you see that?,This week.
"Oh, okay. All right. So it was shown to you in preparation for the deposition?",Yes.
Okay. So what did the letter say that Ms. Dickey,"In essence, to summarize, that she had a suggestion that the that she thought the company should include a statement about underaged smoking and preventing it in their advertising."
Okay.,That was the general theme of the letter.
"Gotcha. And so Mr. Greenwald's writing back in response. And he says to her, you know, we've starting, I guess, with the second sentence, ""We feel that the habits of young people in their teens 0 constitutes sociologic problems and that we should not enter into matters of that sort. Based upon the extensive research which we have conducted over the years, we are convinced that smoking in moderation does 4 not produce any ill effects. It's only indulgence to..."" ""It's only indulgence to excess of cigarettes, or many other things, that may cause harm. If young people are going to smoke, it would be well..."" ""...it would be well to teach them not to overindulge in smoking, nor to overindulge in anythi that they may do."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
And that was the position of Philip Morris in response to Miss Dickey's letter that was written the company in 1952?,
"This was a letter written by a senior official at Philip Morris, right?",
"Well, as a research director in 1952, you wouldn't characterize him as a senior official in the company?",
"And when I say ""you,"" I mean Philip Morris is taking the position that Mr. Greenwald as a research director was not a senior official in the company?","Oh, I interpreted senior official as a j; vice-president or senior executive of the company that ji made broad decisions on behalf of the company. I mean, j research director certainly is a job with significant j responsibility in the company. I don't know exactly I how to -- how you're determining the difference between i levels. But it's not a vice-president position, and it's not an officer of the company in terms of making significant broad decisions on behalf of the company."
"Well, you indicated to me earlier, and I haven't seen the letter but that Ms. Dickey's letter was to the company, to Philip Morris?","I believe, yes."
"And on behalf of Philip Morris, Mr. Greenwald writes this response to Miss Dickey?",
Is that correct?,"Well, he responded to her. I don't know if it was on behalf of Philip Morris as a global statement on the company's position or if he was interjecting some personal opinions in the letter. I don't know."
"Well, as the spokesperson of Philip Morris, you know, I would like to know what the company's 0 position is. Was Mr. Greenwald speaking on behalf of the company here, or was he sort of doing this rogue on his own?",
"And I want to ask you about this letter and whether this was done by Mr. Greenwald, sort of the phrase comes to mind for me sua sponte, but that's obviously, you know, a legal phrase. Was this done by Mr. Strike everything before that. Was this done by Mr. Greenwald on his own, or was this done at the direction of the company?",
"And by ""was,"" I mean this letter that Mr. Greenwald wrote to Miss Gladys Dickey.","I wouldn't know the answer to that. I mean, it's on company letterhead. He signed it with his title, so he was writing the letter as an individual who worked for the company. But I guess for me, I try to put this letter into context of what the company's practice was at that time. And that's why I looked to find the letter that was sent into the company, and then I looked to understand were there other responses sent to consumers when they suggested ideas on behalf from the company, from other individuals. And I found that there were."
"At this same time period in the 1950s? A Q A Q Prior. I Prior to the 1950s? Prior. Prior. And the letters that were written to other individuals who'd also corresponded with Philip Morris, did you bring copies of those letters with you today?","I I don't have them, but I believe my j: attorney has them. :|"
Okay. And are those similar documents that were produced previously?,I didn't. j
"Okay. His final point there is that, if young people are going to smoke, essentially we should teach them to smoke in moderation and not to overindulge.","I see that point, yes."
"And that was, again, part of his response on ; behalf of the company to Ms. Dickey in Encino, California Valentine's Day 1952?",Yes. j
"Who was Johnny, Jr.?","Johnny, Jr. was an individual who was hired I by the company to be a representative for the Philip Morris brand. And he had worked in the company for a I number of years and was known for the ""Call For Philip i Morris"" slogan."
I'm not going to ask you to do it.,"Good. as he did dressed know, man I don't think any of us could do it as well I Good. But he had that kind of signature he ike a bellman or like a Like -- Well, he was a page. ;"
"I guess I could do that. Well, we'll have the actual thing for the jury, but we don't have it here today. Unfortunately, I don't have a very multimedia presentation. But this was a television commercial?","He was -- he was mostly in print ad, but he there was radio commercials. And I'm not sure if there were television commercials. I would have to look back through company records to see that."
"Yeah. And, I mean, you know, television was just sort of coming of age in the 1950s?",Right.
Do you remember one of the shows that Philip Morris sponsored in the 1950s?,The Philip Morris brand or the Philip Morris company?
"That's a good question. I believe it was 0 the Philip Morris brand, but that's owned by Philip Morris company, right?",The Philip Morris brand is owned by the Philip Morris company. 4 Q. Do you remember a time period when they sponsored I Love Lucy?
"And, I mean, the 1950s was sort of a time when rather than what we have today with these, you know, commercials of a bunch of different brands being advertised, oftentimes there would be a sponsor who would be the sponsor for the show who'd get like a little dedicated time at the end or at the beginning?","Sometimes, yes."
"Um-hum. And you don't recall or are you familiar with the fact that Johnny, Jr. was utilized in some of those I Love Lucy episodes when they aired on television?","Johnny, not Johnny, Jr. Johnny, Jr. is a little bit different from Johnny."
"Okay. And you know, it's a good point. Why don't you explain the distinction just so that's clear?","Well, Johnny was the individual who had this perfect pitch in yelling ""Call For Philip Morris."" And then the company had some other individuals who were likened to Johnny, Jr. who may be used in the different manner at an event or a retail store in terms of promoting the Philip Morris brand. 4 Q. Johnny couldn't be everywhere at one time, so they had to get kind of doubles, if you will?"
"Okay. All right. Well, let's look at a couple documents talking about the Johnny, Jr. promotional campaigns. Let's see. This is PT1189. (Defendant's No. PT1189 for i.d.)",
"And you can if you want to slide that one over here, that PT6142, we can keep a record copy of that in order so we've got it.",Okay. j
"So your attorney has handed you a copy of what we've marked as PT1189. And you can see this is a Philip Morris inter-office correspondence, correct?",Yes. j
"And the date is November 23rd, 1953?","That's correct, yes."
"The letter was written or this correspondence was written from a J.A. Mallon to a Mr. Ray Jones, vice-president.",Yes. ;
"Subject is Johnny, Jr. operation?",That's right. \
"So just reading the letter, ""Our general overall plan has been in the past to book as many possible store sale locations for Johnny, Jr. through each divisional territory, bearing in mind that during the week, we would try to take care of rural sections coming into the more thoroughly populated areas for heavier store sales towards the end of the week."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes. Yes, you did."
"All right. And then, ""Instructions have always been that no veterans or service hospitals were to be bypassed. And it has also been made clear that every military installation is to be contacted. ""We have also tried to route "" excuse me "" route Johnny, Jr.'s movements so that he would make appearances at local affairs, such as county fairs, historical celebrations, et cetera."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"""We have been running many store promotions, and it might be well in the future to have Johnny, Jr. scheduled to present various prizes, such as Lucy 0 dolls, et cetera, that might be used in these promotions."" 2 Did I read that correctly?","Yes. 4 Q. Okay. ""The above, plus the fact that we get 5 newspaper publicity, plus radio interviews pretty much www.phippsreporti.ng. com http://www.phippsreporti.ng sums up Johnny, Jr.'s activities in the past."" And then signed by a Mr. J.A. Mallon?"
"So this is sort of summarizing some promotional activities. They were using Johnny, Jr. for taking him around to county fairs, military installations, veteran's hospitals as described in the letter, correct?","It's describing taking the Johnny, Jrs. Going around, yes, not Johnny."
Right.,Not the spokesperson we spoke about necessarily.
Right. Now,"These were these were Johnny, Jr. copies."
Right. Like the doubles we talked about?,Yes.
"They dressed the same. They were intended to, you know, be like the Johnny that people saw on TV 0 or heard on the radio?","Yes. 2 Q. All right. And among the things they talk about are having him, you know, scheduled for store 4 promotions, correct?"
"And as part of the store promotions, they suggested that it be great to have him have prizes to hand out like Lucy dolls, right?","That was this, yes."
"And like we talked about, one of the shows that Philip Morris sponsored was I Love Lucy?",Yes.
"And so the Lucy dolls is referring to a Lucille Ball, a Lucy doll?",That's correct.
"Who do you think that Johnny, Jr. would hand out those Lucy dolls to?","He would hand them out to parents, probably to mothers because at this time there would be children with parents, so he probably would hand it out to the parents for them to hand to their child."
"Urn-hum. I, mean, yeah, it wasn't for like grown men or it wasn't really for a typical adult; is that fair?","No, a doll would be for a child."
Yeah. (Defendant's Exhibit No. PT5030 for i.d.),Thank you. |:
"And your attorney has handed you what we previously marked PT5030, 5030, another Philip Morris inter-office correspondence, correct?",Yes. \
This is from Jack Porterfield to a Mr. J.E. Gallagher?,Yes. \
"And this is dated December 19th, 1953. So a couple weeks after that last letter we looked at, which was November excuse me November 23rd, 1953?",Yes. \
"So this is a few weeks later. Subject also Johnny, Jr. operation?",Yes.
Is that correct?,Yes. ;
"And so this is looking at some scheduling for the State of Arkansas, promotional activities within the State of Arkansas?","Yes. It appears that way. There's Little I Rock, Arkansas at the top. :"
For the office?,Y e s .
"Right. And then that top sentence says, ""As far as I can recommend on the future arranging of schedules for Johnny, Jr. in the State of Arkansas would be:"" And then there's a list one, two, three, four?",Y e s .
"Okay. Looking at number three, the number three item they have there says, ""I think that in every case so far that it was proven that newspaper and radio publicity are a must..."" underline ""...with his appearance."" Do you see that?",I do.
"Recognizing that there was an importance to getting newspaper and radio publicity with this appearance by Johnny, Jr. in these various places?",
Is that a fair characterization?,"Well, I think in this letter this is a recommendation and where Mr. Porterfield is saying that I think that it's important to have publicity about Johnny, Jr.'s appearance. Right. To maximize his appearance, if you 1 Q- will?"
"Um-hum. And then number four there, he's recommending that, ""I think a tie-in with a leading department store in the larger towns would be a good publicity stunt for Johnny,"" correct?","That's what he that's what he that's what he thinks, yes, correct."
"""This may be would not sell cigarettes on the spot, but it would create Philip Morris in the minds of our future smokers."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"""This would be a good gimmick to get women and children into the department stores, and in return they would give Philip Morris good publicity in the area. I understand from Johnny, Jr., Gus Wayne, that 0 the idea of candy Philip Morris 4s for children has already been mentioned. 2 ""Very truly yours, Jack Porterfield?"" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did. 5 Q. So this is Mr. Porterfield who is working with Johnny, Jr., and he's acknowledging that, you know, these publicity stunts are important recommendations, at least in his opinion?"
"Well, do you know who Jack Porterfield was?",I understand he was in the sales organization.
"He was a salesman working for Philip Morris, right?","Yes, he was."
"And so he said that, you know, this leading department store tie-in would be a good publicity stunt for Johnny, right?","That's what he thinks, yes."
"And he says, This wouldn't sell cigarettes on the spot or I guess maybe would not sell cigarettes on the spot, but it would create Philip 0 Morris in the minds of our future smokers. That's what it says, right?",
"Yeah. Someone advertising or a marketing standpoint, what does that mean when you try to create your brand in the mind of your future consumer?",
"Well, and I don't want to speculate. We've talked about this before, and I haven't gone through your qualifications. But you've got a you've had a lengthy career in marketing?",Yes.
And specifically working for Philip Morris?,Yes.
"Based on, you know, your experience in marketing and as the designee here to talk about, you know, marketing subjects, what does that mean when you're trying to create a brand in the mind of your 0 future consumer?",Sure.
"Sure, right?","On a personal level, yes."
Yes.,"Am I familiar with the idea of building awareness for a brand, yes."
And that's what he's referring to here is sort of build the awareness or the buzz about Philip Morris in the minds of our future smokers?,
"And the event is about the brand? I mean, the reason they're having the event is to promote the brand, right?","Yeah, but he uses the word ""publicity"" if we go back to this statement. ""I think in every case so i far that it was proven that newspaper and radio \ publicity are a must with his appearance."" So it seems as though he' s talking about j: publicity to have people come to the location so that j; Johnny, Jr. has an audience. ;"
"Yeah. In fact, he talks about that a little more in that next sentence. He says, ""This would be a good gimmick to get women and children into the department stores. And in return, they would give Philip Morris good publicity in the area."" Right?","Yes. So he's saying if we advertise on i radio, in the newspaper that Johnny's going to be at l the store, people will come, and that will give the brand good publicity."
"Not just people, women and children.","Well, he wants the adults. He's, I mean ;"
"Well, he says women and children, right?",He does.
"And then he talks about Gus Wayne, and Gus Wayne was the Johnny, he was the guy, right?","Gus Wayne was a Johnny, Jr. Gus Wayne I wasn't the Johnny."
"Well, who was the Johnny?","The famous Johnny, I don't recall his name i off the top of my head. But it wasn't Gus Wayne. ji"
You're sure it wasn't Gus Wayne?,That's my understanding it was not j: Gus Wayne . j;
"And what well, how did you get that understanding?",From other documents that I had read a ji number of years ago. \
"Okay. Those documents, you don't have those with you today?",No. \
"But you have some understanding that you believe Gus Wayne wasn't the real, if you call him real Johnny?","He wasn't the prime Johnny, the official i Johnny. He was a Johnny, Jr. :"
"Was he like number two Johnny, Jr.?",
Okay.,I think there was Johnny and then there was ; everybody else.
"Johnny and everybody else. Okay. Well, was Johnny's name Johnny like the real Johnny? Was that his name?",
"Okay. Well, you don't have to give me a hard time just because I don't know that. You know, you can just tell me.",
"So, anyways, I understand from Johnny, Jr., Gus Wayne and are there was there multiple Johnny, Jrs.?","My understanding, there were multiple ; Johnny, Jrs . jj"
"One of the main ones, though, was Gus Wayne?",
"Let me ask you this way. Have you seen other Johnny, Jrs. mentioned by name in other documents?",I've not looked for that. So they may very I well be. I don't know. I
But you haven't seen it?,"No, I've not seen it."
"Okay. And Johnny, Jr., Gus Wayne, says the idea of candy Philip Morris 4s for children has already been mentioned. So when they say Philip Morris's 4s, what they mean is like a little, Philip Morris had samples of Philip Morris brand cigarettes that came in like four-packs, right, with four cigarettes?",Yes.
"And that's what they called Philip Morris 4s because they'd use those to sample, you know, adults or in the military if they put them in sea rations or whatever it might be?",
"And when he's referring to Philip Morris 4s, all I'm trying to establish is that's a like a smaller pack; it doesn't have 20 cigarettes in it; it had four cigarettes in it?","That's correct. 0 Q. Okay. And so he's saying candy Philip Morris 4s, so the same size, same pack but candy cigarettes to hand out to the children?"
"Let me hand you what we've marked as PT2214. Your attorney has handed you what we previously marked PT2214, which is a letter from J.E. Gallagher, who, I believe, was the recipient of the last one we looked at. 7 A. Yes.",
"And if you want to refer if you need to refer to that, it's right here.",I recall that. j
"Jack Porterfield wrote his letter December 19th, 1953, PT5030, he wrote that letter to J.E. Gallagher, right?",Yes. I
"Okay. And so now we have Mr. J.E. Gallagher I about, what is that, five days later, December 24th, 1953, five days later. And he's writing to Mr. Ray Jones. 19 A. Yes, that's correct. 0 Q. And this is, again, Philip Morris inter-office correspondence? 2 2 A. Yes.",
"Same subjects we've seen on the last two 4 documents, Johnny, Jr.'s operation? 5 A. Yes. f",
"Mr. Gallagher in this letter to Mr. Jones writes as follows: ""Thank you for your letter of November 19th wherein you state you would appreciate receiving any advises (sic) and recommendations regarding Johnny, Jr.'s work plan in the past and any suggestions we may have for the future. Personally, I think our work plan to date has been very satisfactory and believe we should continue to keep Johnny, Jr. working in rural areas. If possible, it would be better to give him Monday off and work Saturday because in rural areas, the townspeople congregate around the courthouse. And this presents an excellent opportunity to win their favor by sampling them and selling them Philip Morris."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"Okay. So just to break this down into a couple of chunks, Mr. Gallagher is now writing to Mr. Ray Jones. Do you know who Mr. Jones was?",From the other memo you see he's the vice-president of sales.
Vice-president of sales. Right?,"Yes. 4 Q. So Mr. Gallagher is writing to the VP of sales, and he's saying, thank you for your letter of November 19th where you essentially asked for, give us some ideas or recommendations regarding Johnny, Jr., right?"
"And so Mr. Gallagher says, ""I think our plan to date has been very satisfactory, and we should continue working Johnny in these rural areas.""",That's correct.
"And one suggestion he has here is to let him have Monday off and work Saturday. Do you understand I mean, obviously the implication was that he was working Monday through Friday previously.",Yes.
And so they say let's let him have Monday off and have him work Tuesday through Saturday?,That's correct.
"And the reasoning is because in rural areas on Saturday, townspeople congregate around the courthouse? 0 A. That's correct.",
"And this is probably a concept that is, you 2 know, maybe still happening today but not nearly as much where people would just kind of gather around the 4 courthouse which usually was in the center of the 5 county's rural towns?",
In these rural towns.,
"Urn-hum. Right. And it said, ""This presents an excellent opportunity to win their favor by sampling them and selling them Philip Morris.""","That's what it says, yes."
"And we were just talking about that a second ago. So typically when they would sample, with sampling practices, they would have those little 4s that had four cigarettes in there?",
"I mean, are there what was more common at least at that time in the 1950s when they would sample, those 4s, or would they actually give out entire, you know, full 20-cigarette packs of Philip Morris?",
Okay. That's not something that you studied or made an effort to ascertain Philip Morris's knowledge on for today's deposition?,"Yeah, not specifically the size of samples, quantity of samples, things of that nature. I don't even know if that data would be available."
"Well, when you were in the marketing department at Philip Morris for a number of years, 0 would ya'll do sampling?","There was some sampling done during some of the time frame when I was an employee, but the company stopped sampling in the '90s. In fact, in '95 they made a firm policy that there would be no more sampling."
"The sampling that was done that you're familiar with before that '95 decision you just referred to, was it done with 4s or whole packs, 20-cigarette packs? How was the sampling done?","Yeah, I don't recall the details of how it was done. I mean, sometimes I know there were smaller packs of cigarettes, but I don't recall how many cigarettes were in them."
"Okay. Well, you're familiar with the practice of using those 4s like we saw in that other document for sampling?",At times 4s have been used for sampling. I'm not familiar with the practice of whether that was infrequent or frequently or the extent to which larger a sample product was provided.
"Okay. So sometimes it was 4s; sometimes it could have been a larger sample. You're just not sure of the frequency or how often, which one was used?","That's correct. 0 Q. But, in any event, sampling was giving out free cigarettes?"
"Okay. Here they're talking about having 4 Johnny, Jr. go to the courthouse on Saturday where the 5 people have congregated and giving them free Philip Morris cigarettes?",
"And then the it says, ""Attached you will find suggestions and remarks from the division managers and supervisors that work with Johnny, Jr. in this section."" Have you seen that attachment?",I've seen the attachment you have here.
"Yeah, right. But have you seen the other, the other attachment that says, suggestions and remarks from division managers, supervisors that work with Johnny, Jr. in this section?",No. \
"It looks I mean, what I'm saying is it looks like there were a couple of attachments.","Yeah. No, I've not seen. ;"
You haven't seen that other one?,"Not beyond this, no."
Okay. And I hadn't either. I was just seeing if it was something that you had seen that I had missed or if it,No.
it's just lost for the past few times.,"Yeah, no."
"Okay. It says, ""You will also find a letter from Gus Wayne wherein he suggests that we make up some Philip Morris chocolate cigarettes to give to children,"" correct?",Yes.
"And that's the attachment that we do have that is attached to the back, which we'll refer to in just a moment here, correct?",Yes.
"""In my opinion, this is an excellent suggestion. It is hoped that this information will be of some help to you in planning Johnny, Jr.'s work in the future. ""Signed, yours very truly, J.E. Gallagher."" 0 Right?",Yes.
"Okay. And so we have attached to the back of this a handwritten letter, same letterhead, Philip 4 Morris inter-office correspondence dated December 6th, 1953?",Yes. j
"And this is a letter from Gus Wayne who's a Johnny, Jr.?",Yes. \
"To Mr. J.E. Gallagher, subject being sales promotion?",Yes. \
"Okay. And so Johnny, Jr., Gus Wayne writes, ""Dear, Mr. Gallagher, As you suggested, I'm submitting my idea for which I feel will stimulate sales of Philip Morris. ""In my travels, I've noticed that ""Johnny,"" is more readily recognized by the children than the adults. Children being very impressionable, remembering things they see and hear long after they've i; occurred. ""Here now I further feel based on my observations that the Philip Morris trademark, ""Johnny,"" has fallen into the same category as Hopalong Cassidy, Howdy Doody, et cetera."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did. i"
All right. And so this is 1953. Hopalong Cassidy and Howdy Doody were popular television figures?,Yes. j
Cowboys?,"I don't I don't know. Hopalong Cassidy, ji yes . Howdy Doody? jj"
"Well, Hopalong Cassidy and Howdy Doody were do you understand them to have been sort of cowboys, if you will, on television? That was their character?",
And maybe you're right. I apologize. I could be wrong. I wasn't born in 1953 either. So I may be wrong. But you understand them to be television figures?,. Y e s . Ji
Howdy Doody and Hopalong Cassidy were popular figures on television?,"They were popular figures, yes. jj"
And they were popular amongst children?,"That's my understanding, they were popular ; amongst children. i necessary Okay. ""Due to these facts, I found it to when I'm making appearances in supermarkets, drug stores, et cetera, to buy and hand out to the children bars of candy, chocolates, lollipops my idea. chocolate et cetera."" Correct? Yes, that's what it says. i ""How then, here's my "" Sorry. ""Now then..."" I believe it says ""... here's We could, if you feel it has merit, have a cigarette made up in Philip Morris wrappers and in the process of handing guest..."" excuse ""...guest packages out to the adults, we could give the children a replica of our Philip Morris guest package containing chocolate cigarettes."" because I packages, they used Did I read that correctly? Yes, you did. j: And do you think that's guest or quest, honestly can't tell? It would be guest right? I think it's guest. And is that guest packages is another way to refer to those 4s that we were talking about earlier?"
Okay. Not something you're familiar with?,No.
"So picking up where we left off, ""I feel that the gesture in conjunction with 'Johnny' personally handing them to the children will remain in their minds for years to come. This, too, is based on one of my visits to a Piggly Wiggly food chain store in Greenwood, Mississippi. A store sale was held, and the response to the advanced publicity was overwhelming. We were greeted by a group of children (over 200), and the ovation that I received from them was indeed heartwarming. It was necessary after sampling the adults to give the children each some candy and et cetera, which was received by the parents with great appreciation and amazement."" And then the final page there, ""Win a child's affection and admiration, and you have won the loyalty of the parents. ""Sincerely, Gus Wayne."" 0 Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"Okay. So this it was the suggestion that we saw referred to in both, you know, this PT2214 and in 4 the prior document we looked at, PT5030 talking about preparing some Philip Morris candy cigarettes, chocolate cigarettes to hand out to kids?",It was the suggestion that was rejected by the company.
Okay. And have you seen documents where that suggestion was affirmatively rejected?,"I don't need to see a document showing an affirmative rejection. What I did was I looked to understand did the company ever manufacture candy cigarettes or contract for candy cigarettes in the United States. And I did not see that, see any evidence of that. So typically the company doesn't have a practice of shooting down people's ideas with rejection letters ."
"Right. Well, I understand rejected",They just don't go they just don't go forward with them.
It just doesn't happen.,"Just doesn't happen. 0 Q. Okay. One thing you also didn't see, thought, was ever anyone from Philip Morris instructing Gus Wayne or anyone else to stop buying the kids chocolate and things of that nature?"
because I think the letter may dispel that thought this is a limited occurrence.,Okay.
If you look at the first page of Gus's letter there,Of Gus's letter.
"Yeah, of Gus's letter down at the bottom where it says, ""Due to these facts...""",Down at the bottom.
"Well, it","""Due to these facts..."" Yes."
"Right. I mean, the paragraph above is where he's talking about children being very impressionable and how, you know, when he based on his observations that trademark Johnny is the same as Hopalong Cassidy or Howdy Doody, correct?",Yes.
"And then he says, ""Due to these facts, I 0 have found it necessary to when I'm making appearances in supermarkets, drug stores, et cetera, to buy and 2 hand out to the children bars of candy, chocolates; l o l l i p o p s , e t c e t e r a . ""","I see your p o i n t , y e s . 5 Q. So I th ink t h i s an A Q You're absolutely right. i I think this was something he was doing on ongoing basis. A Q Yeah. And, you know, obviously, you're not familiar with anywhere where Philip Morris ever told him, you know, don't do that; we don't want to encourage the children or we don't want to give gifts to children?"
"Um-hum. Mr. Gallagher, in his opinion, told Ray Jones that this was an excellent suggestion, though?",Yes.
"And do you know from this campaign, this Johnny, Jr. effort, do you know sort of how they were defining children as far as the ones who should be getting the candy cigarettes and how they were defining, you know, who was getting the samples of Philip Morris cigarettes?",
"Well, how they were defining it. In other words, their suggestion was to make some chocolate cigarettes to give to children by Gus Wayne that we've talked about and that Mr. Gallagher thought was an 0 excellent suggestion, correct?","Yes. 2 Q. And you've told, you know, the company didn't do that? 4 A. Right. 5 Q. What I'm asking you is: Are you aware where are you aware of anywhere, any information, any source where they describe who's getting the samples of the Philip Morris cigarettes and who the children were that they thought could get the chocolate cigarettes?"
And the documents you're talking about are documents that were later than this in time that you've seen?,"Prior to this and for all the decades that I could look into, you know, general documents of the company."
"I didn't say this at the outset, but I think you probably are familiar with this. If at any time 4 you want a break, you're in charge today.",Okay. Q A Q A So Oka tell us if you want a break. y. I'11 try to pick reasonable times as well. Sur
"Hi, Miss Bonhomme. Moving forward, let me hand you bear with me. Before I hand you these documents, let me just sort of establish a couple of things. You're familiar with the idea that most cigarette smokers begin smoking regularly before the age of 25?","I'm familiar with that idea, yes. j;"
"And, in fact, most cigarette smokers, the majority begin smoking regularly before the age of 18?",
"Well, let me rephrase the question, see if you agree with this. And I'm not asking for all of the details. I'm just asking for what I think is a pretty well-established point. Most regular smokers began smoking before the age of 18.","As I said, there's it's a very complicated subject. If you're asking me tried a cigarette before the age of 18, most regular smokers have tried a cigarette before the age of 18. But there's a variety of data sources that show smoking rates for 18, 19, 20, 21-year-olds. And that's a significant number of individuals. And if by most you mean greater than 51 percent, so since I've spent my career working with a lot of information, I'm going to try to pin you down so that it properly communicates with accuracy the situation. 21 Q. The majority, yeah. So greater than percent of regular smokers began smoking before the age of 18. Do you on behalf of Philip Morris agree or 4 disagree with that statement?"
Or marketing at individuals over the age of that has an effect on those under the age of 18?,
"Okay. So when we're talking about youth, we're talking about folks who are under the age of 18?",Y e s . I
"Is it your position on behalf of Philip Morris today that the majority, greater than percent, of regular smokers begin smoking before the age of 18 or after the age of 18?",
"All right. Well, we'll come back to that a little bit later with some other documents. Let me just move forward to what we've marked as PT6127. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6127 for i.d.)",
"So this is a May 31st, 1955 Sydney M. Cantor & Associates Consulting Chemists?",Yes.
"And that's, I guess, the author and the company who produced the document letter written to Dr. R.N. DuPuis, vice-president Philip Morris Incorporated?",Yes.
And that's Robert DuPuis?,"I believe so, yes."
"Okay. Subject line is ""Taste Testing of Cigarettes? """,Yes.
"Let me call your attention first to that last paragraph on the first page. It says, ""Certainly the fact that taste and flavor play a decisive role in determining the popularity of a cigarette has been stressed in cigarette advertising, and the experts can perhaps be accused of becoming sold on their own advertising message. This is not to say that the taste and flavor do not have a part in the choice but rather that this part has been overestimated among major brands because it represents a desirable and simple 0 distinction between cigarettes and one which is above reproach so far as advertising is concerned."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes. 4 Q. All right. And then within this letter Mr. Cantor goes on to sort of describe like in the middle of that next paragraph, he says, ""The flavorful aspects of a cigarette..."" Di you see where I'm"
"""The flavorful aspects of a cigarette may be important in the first cigarette of the day, but I doubt very much whether the habitual smoker can honestly detect any flavor differences, except major ones, the amount of Turkish tobacco, for example, in succeeding cigarettes."" And then if you'll turn to the last page there...",
"Okay. Which, I think, you know, kind of brings us to the point I'm trying to make here is this top paragraph on the third page. ""Your sales also would indicate that 0 advertising and perhaps the flavor appeal is important only to the new smoker or undecided smoker because if smoking a particular brand is the habit we think it is, then, as with any other habit, including the habit of smoking, it is extremely hard to break."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"And the predicate to this was this question that I was asking you about how most people begin smoking or have their first cigarette under the age of who then go on to become regular cigarette smokers. And and given that to be the case, at least what I believe, Mr. Cantor is acknowledging here to Mr. DuPuis that that flavor appeal is important to those new smokers or the undecided smokers, people who haven't smoked yet?",
"And I'm sure you don't remember the question that I asked you, which was lengthy and a while ago.",Not exactly.
"Let me ask this again. Mr. Cantor is acknowledging here to Mr. DuPuis, who was the vice-president in charge of, you know, R&D at that time for Philip Morris, that sales would indicate that flavor appeal is important only to the new smoker and the undecided smoker. Because earlier on he's acknowledging in this document how, you know, with flavor of success of cigarettes you !; don't notice of the flavor anymore. It's just not there. That's essentially what he's saying in this letter. Would you agree?",
"Just to clarify for the record, you were in youth smoking prevention after the year 2000?","Yes, 2000 to 2004. \"
"Okay. Certainly not in 1955, right?",I was three-years old.
"And in 1955, Philip Morris had no youth smoking prevention program?","They had no youth smoking prevention I department, right. \"
"Um-hum, right. All right. Let's move on to a different subject.",
"All right. So the first one there is PT6018. So you have PT6018 which is a letter dated March 10th, 1961?",Yes. \
"Okay. And this is a letter written by Helmut Wakeham, director of research and development for Philip Morris?",Yes.
"It's written to Mr. Joseph Bevis, I believe it's pronounced, president, Opinion Research Co rpo r at i on ?",Yes.
"And that's in Princeton, New Jersey?",Yes.
"It says, Dear, Joe, Does Opinion Research Corporation do product profile testing based on consumer needs and desires for product characteristics? If so, we would be pleased to have your representative call on us to tell us what you have done along this line. If he is able to sell us, we would expect to pose some questions and invite a proposal for future work by ORC."" Correct? Yes And ORC being Opinion Research Corporation? That's correct. Next, if you will, Mr. Geraghty, I'll hand you PT6020. And if you want",
"Mr. another letter to Mr. Joseph Bevis from Helmut Wakeham, director of research and development.",Yes.
"Says, ""Dear, Joe, In response to your letter of March 27th, we are proposing herewith for your conversation four question areas. Number one, Why does the nonsmoker not smoke? Is it because he dislikes the taste of cigarettes or because he does not feel the need to indulge in smoking which is considered bad? Is it because he is apprehensive from a health standpoint? Under what circumstances would the nonsmoker be willing to take up smoking?"" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, I did."
"And this is so essentially Dr. Wakeham, director of research and development for Philip Morris, Incorporated is posing some question areas that he wants Opinion Research Corporation to look into for him or possible areas to look into.","Yes, in looking at it he is saying here's some thoughts on potential projects, and I want you to j think about it, and then the company requested that | they select two. |"
"Yeah. But among the thoughts that Dr. Wakeham, director of research and development has, the things that are he's mulling over having Opinion Research Corporation look into is why does the nonsmoker not smoke and under what circumstances would the nonsmoker be willing to take up smoking, correct?",
"It says, Under what circumstances would the nonsmoker be willing to take up smoking?",Right. I
"And the first sentence there says, ""Why does the nonsmoker not smoke?"" in that same paragraph.",Yes. So and I didn't understand your | question. I'm sorry. |
I'm sorry. I'm saying those are the things that he's considering having Opinion Research 0 Corporation look into?,Yes. I
Those are the areas that as director of research and development he's identified as possible 4 areas that are concerns for him. Why does the nonsmoker not smoke; under what circumstances would the nonsmoker be willing to take up smoking are number one there?,
"And as you pointed out, he said I think you should try not to tackle all four of these subjects. I would suggest you pick two with which you think you could be most successful in your study, right?",That's correct. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6020 for i.d.) j
Okay. So looking at PT6020... This is 6020? Yeah. What's that other one you've got there?,This is the prior one. ;
Okay. Great. You can kind of leave them. I don't know if you want to refer to them again.,Okay.
"I'm just going through a few of these that I think are related, and there may be some questions in general about this time and this project, so I guess best to keep it in front of you there just in case you want to refer back to it.",Okay. !:
But looking at PT6020,Okay. |:
"which is a one-page letter dated July 24th, 1961, and this is, again, from Dr. Helmut Wakeham, vice-president and director of research and development, Philip Morris, Incorporated",Correct. jj
"to the Opinion Research Corporation, Princeton, New Jersey, attention: Mr. Joseph Bevis, chairman of the board.",Yes. j
"And among other things in this letter, they identify that Dr. Dunn, Dr. W.L. Dunn, William Dunn, will be the representative on behalf of Philip Morris who will work with you in the development of this program that he's referring to, correct?",Yes. \
"And that program being the for this letter, talking about a study on cigarette packaging and smoker satisfaction as outlined in your proposal dated June 1961, correct?",Yes.
And that was one of the programs that they had selected to go forward on was a cigarette packaging and smoker satisfaction study?,That's correct. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6021 for i.d.)
"All right. So let's look at PT6021. So PT6021 is a December 27th, 1961 letter from the Opinion Research Corporation to Dr. Dunn.",Yes.
"And this letter is actually written by a name which I will struggle to pronounce but looks likes Shoi Balaban Dickinson, Ph.D.?",Yes.
All right. And that's the survey director for the Opinion Research Corporation?,"I believe so, yes."
At least that's what's written in there is the title?,"Yes. 0 Q. And this letter to Dr. Dunn it says, ""Dear Bill, As I mentioned when we were in Richmond, we were planning to offer a new research service studying the teenage market. Any company interested in obtaining 4 information on teenagers' use of their products or teenagers' attitudes toward their products can participate. With this kind of multiple sponsorship we can offer a very attractive price to individual participants. The sample for the ORC teen study will consist of 1,000 teenagers and will be a nationwide probability sample. Personal interviews will be conducted by our trained ORC resident interviewers. Since teenagers currently constitute a portion of the cigarette market and are continually entering that market, we think this research service will be of interest to you. We have developed a 30 or 40-minute presentation which covers all the teenage market and discusses how to reach it effectively, as well as describing in detail what the ORC teen study can do. ""I would like to come to Richmond and do this presentation for those people to whom you think this would be of their interest. May I suggest January 24th, January 25th, either morning or afternoon is possible. 0 ""Thanks?"" Correct?"
So we saw earlier that Dr. Dunn had been 4 designated as a representative on behalf of Philip Morris in that letter from Dr. Wakeham?,Yes.
"So and so Opinion Research Corporation, this survey director, I think it's a Ms. Dickinson, is writing a letter to Dr. Dunn offering a new research service on obtaining information from teenagers?",Yes.
Correct?,Correct.
"All right. Let me turn your attention to PT6143. Oh, I'm sorry. Before I do that, one of the parts of the letter is identified in here, I think it's the fourth paragraph, says, ""Since teenagers currently constitute a portion of the cigarette market and are continually entering that market, we think this research service will be of interest to you. Regardless of, you know, their ORC's feelings of whether the research service is of interest, I wanted to focus on the first two pieces of that sentence.",Okay.
"""Since teenagers currently constitute a portion of the cigarette market..."" That was true. In 1961 and in the 1950s and even today teenagers 4 constitute a portion of the cigarette market.","Yes, that is common knowledge, yes."
Okay. And they are continually entering that market. That's also true?,"Yes, that is common knowledge. Rates are declining most recently."
Right.,"Youth smoking rates are lower this year than prior years. But, yes, teenagers are entering that market."
"In the 1960s the youth smoking rates were not declining; they were increasing, weren't they?","I can't off the top of my head answer that. There were time periods after the 1960s where there were increases, but I can't specifically off the top of my head say what was going on in the '60s, if it was steady or increasing or declining."
"Okay. And the teenagers that are continually entering that market would be the people the market who the market she's referring to is cigarette market, smokers, right?","That's what she's referring to, yes."
And so entering that market means becoming smokers?,"Yes. As the population ages, the younger children become teenagers, and some of them experiment with cigarettes and start to smoke, yes."
And some of them become regular smokers.,"And some of them become regular smokers, \ yes. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6143 for i.d.)"
"Okay. Let's look at PT6143. And I'm sorry. If you're taking notes and I'm handing you those documents, next time I'll just keep them over here. Sorry about that. Just causing you to have to stop taking notes.",
"All right. So that we have a letter dated February 8th, 1962?",Yes. I
"From the Opinion Research Corporation, again, Miss Dickinson?",Yes. \
Written to Dr. Dunn again?,"Yes, that's correct."
"And this is PT6143 for the record. So this is, what would that be, about a month, maybe month and a half, not quite a month and a half after the last letter we looked at?",Yes.
"Okay. It says, Dear, Bill, This is just to keep you up to date on our follow-up of showing our teen study presentation to Jet Lincoln."" So sometime between December 27th when Miss Dickinson writes this letter to Dr. Dunn suggesting coming down and coming to Richmond to make a presentation for involvement in the teen study, Dr. Dunn presumably corresponded with her and arranged for that to happen?",
"Well, someone from Philip Morris communicated with Ms. Dickinson, and she came down to Richmond and made a presentation to Jet Lincoln?",That's fair.
"Okay. ""Joe Bevis and I called on Mr. Lincoln yesterday and felt we received a good 0 hearing for the teen study. However, Mr. Lincoln had made it very clear on the telephone even before we went over that he really was not particularly interested in this but would look at it. 4 ""I am still very eager to show this to you, Bill, not necessarily because I thin you might participate in the study at this time, but because I think it is something you should know about as a means of collecting information on a market that is very important to you. ""The next time you're in New York if your schedule permits, perhaps we could get together, and I could put on this presentation for you."" And then she talks about an article that appeared in Time Magazine.",Yes.
"Okay. The Jet Lincoln, what was his role in this at this time?",He was a senior executive.
Okay.,"I don't know his exact title, but executive."
Senior executive?,Um-hum.
"So they made the presentation to Mr. 0 Lincoln, and he just wasn't that interested?","That's correct. 22 Q. All right. And in years to come after Philip Morris, though, would use the Opinion Research 4 Corporation for some survey work and some studies, 5 correct? j"
And some of the studies that they used Opinion Research Corporation for involved collecting information from teenagers?,
Right. And that's what I was referring to.,"However, if you are speaking to that | would be ten years down the road, different department | 19 of people. Different purpose. 0 Q. Yeah."
Right.,This looks like this is a study that they were putting in place with other organizations and wanted Philip Morris to join into that creation of that study. It would be cross-product categories.
"Yeah, just by way of context, that happens frequently where organizations would put a study out and ask, for example, if it was a study of teenagers, they would put a study out that asks about what bicycle do you own; maybe what, you know, car does your family own; what soda do you drink. And, you know, if it was involving gathering information on cigarette smoking, they'd say what cigarettes do you smoke?",Yes. And
And then they would sell it to the different 0 companies?,"To even clarify that further, oftentimes they start creating the study by getting the involvement of other, of companies. So my interpretation of this is they were at the very early stages with this teenage initiative. And it was a program they wanted to put in place so that companies i could participate in the creation of the study and ji direction of the study. And then subsequently into I other companies that weren't involved in the details of l the project could for a fee add a few questions to the j; study. ;"
"Add a question to that, yeah.",Yes. \
"And you what you mentioned earlier is although they only used Opinion Research Corporation for other aspects of the proposal that we looked at earlier, they eventually in years to come, I think it was in the '70s at least at the earliest, they began using Opinion Research Corporation. Philip Morris you know, that question got way too long. Too many days. You mentioned earlier that Philip Morris eventually used Opinion Research Corporation for studying teenage smoking.",
"Right. But they eventually as I was asking, they eventually used Opinion Research Corporation to do some research on teenage smoking?",
Go ahead.,"Okay. From what I saw, I wouldn't characterize it that they used Opinion Research to conduct research. I would characterize it as that they j acquired some information from Opinion Research. On \ two occasions, very limited information. So it wasn't ; that they later got information that was in-depth tied I to this project. \"
Right. Okay.,Very different. i
"I understand what you're saying. Earlier we looked at PT0169, which I think we just mentioned a minute ago about the four 9 j proposals, if you will, for Opinion Research Corporation.",Yes. I
"And, as you mentioned, they didn't it appears they didn't use Opinion Research Corporation for number one.",That's correct. I
Why does the nonsmoker not smoke? Under what circumstances would the nonsmoker be willing to take up smoking?,Yes. That's correct. | (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT99999 for i.d.) |
"Okay. Let me show you what we marked as PT99999. And I apologize. This was one where there's a different PT number eventually for this, but it's somehow some got goofed up, so I just assigned it 99999 | so we can see what it is in the record. 19 MR. GERAGHTY: All right. And I object to this document as outside the scope. |",Yes.
"And it basically says, you know, there's subjects that are going to be related to projects at a meeting to be held at 9:30, Friday, November 10th setting forth sort of, if you will, an overview of short-term and long-term projects. Is that an accurate description or a fair characterization I should say?",
"Well, I'll just ask you a different way if I will. This letter, this memo to the members of the Research and Development Operating Committee sets forth some short-term and long-term projects for research and development.",It's it's short term and long term. I don't know if they're projects or what they are.
"Well, the title is product and process objectives research and development. You see that?","Yes, I see that."
So at least we can say these are short-term and long-term objectives. How's that?,
"Okay. All right. Well, I don't want to quarrel over those things.",Okay.
The only reason I'm showing you this is that I want to you look at this document.,All right. \
"I want you to see that, you know, obviously Dr. Wakeham who we've mentioned from PT6019, April 7th, 1961, that other letter, right?",Yes. j
"We've got Dr. Dunn there at the bottom, Bill Dunn?",Yes.
We've got Dr. R.B. Seligman?,Yes.
And you know Dr. Seligman would eventually become director of research and development?,Yes.
Okay. And then Dr. Wakeham is mentioned down there at the bottom as well?,Yes.
And Dr. Mace?,Yes. :
"Okay. The longterm objectives, down there at the bottom, one of the long-term objectives was cigarette for the new smoker. Do you see that?","I see those words. I don't see the word j; ""objective."" I just see ""long-term."" ;"
"Okay. All right. Under long-term it says, ""Cigarette for the new smoker,"" correct?",Yes.
"And the new smoker is someone who was a nonsmoker and now has become a smoker, right? That would be a new smoker?",
"All right. So, I mean, on behalf of let me strike that. You don't understand that new smoker means someone who is a new smoker, someone who wasn't a smoker and now is a smoker?",
Okay.,I'm not familiar with whether this phrase here ties to that -- the definition that was used in the marketing and marketing research department or not. I don't know.
"What you're saying is that the marketing department, you're familiar with the idea of wanting to get someone to become a new Marlboro smoker or a new Philip Morris brand smoker, not someone who was a nonsmoker that's going to become a smoker?",
"So we have again, this is a document created by Bill Dunn, William L. Dunn, Jr.?",Yes.
Assistant to the director of Philip Morris Research Center?,Yes.
"He was staff assistant to Helmut Wakeham, the director of R&D?",That's my understanding.
"Okay. And the top at the top there's a date, 6-20-62? You see it above the instructions.","Oh, the handwritten, yes. Okay."
"And so essentially there's an instructions page here. It says as follows: ""We are constantly trying to improve our present cigarettes and exploring possibilities for new cigarettes. During the next two days, we'd like to have you smoke some test cigarettes and tell us what you think of them."" 0 And then it goes on to describe what, you know, they want them to do, how many packs you're going to get and, et cetera. It gives some additional instructions. Is that fair?",Yeah.
"Okay. What I want t o t u r n your a t t e n t i o n t o is the last page. So in addition to giving cigarettes to smokers, they were also giving cigarettes to nonsmokers and asking them to take a few puffs of these cigarettes, correct?","That's what this shows, yes."
"Yeah. So it says, ""Questionnaire for nonsmokers: We know that smoking cigarettes is not something you enjoy doing. However, we're going to ask you to take a few puffs off of some cigarettes because it is vital that we get some idea about what kind of cigarette would appeal to a beginning smoker."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"""We believe their tastes are different from those of people who have been smoking for sometime."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"All right. So then he says, ""We're giving 0 you have three small packets of cigarettes. Light one up, take a few puffs. Go through all three packs in this manner."" Is that fair?","That's what it says. 4 Q. Yes. And then in the spaces below, ""Write the letters of the cigarettes so as to indicate your preference. In the first space write the letter of the \ cigarette you would most probably smoke if you intended \ to start smoking. In the bottom space write the letter of the one you dislike the most. And put the other into the middle space."" Did I read that correctly?"
"Okay. And then it says, ""Bring this one questionnaire with you tomorrow at coffee morning break in exchange for your gift. We will have extra questionnaires if you happen to forget this one. Thank you. "" Correct?","Yes, that's what it says."
So Dr. Dunn was doing some research with some folks who worked for Philip Morris on what type cigarette would appeal to a beginning smoker.,
"Well, I'm not asking what Dr. Dunn is thinking.",
Do you understand that?,Yes. \
"All right. What I want to know is are you prepared to testify today about Philip Morris's efforts in 1962 as documented in this in this letter, this document from Dr. Dunn regarding their efforts to identify what kind of cigarette would appeal to a beginning smoker?",No. \
Okay. Had you seen this document before today?,Yes. j
Okay. So it was shown to you by your attorney,Yes. after we produced the documents? Yes. \ All right. But you are not prepared today to testify about this subject?
"And as part of that program, Philip Morris became aware of its airing before it aired.",Yes. \ (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6145 for i.d.) \
"Let's look at what we've marked as PT6145. All right. So I've handed you what we've marked as PT6145. It's a letter from Leo Burnett company to a Ross Millhiser, I believe it is",Yes. j
"at Philip Morris, Incorporated?",Yes.
Leo Burnett Company was Philip Morris's principal outside advertising agency?,Yes. \
Is that accurate?,That's correct.
"Okay. The letter dated September 10th, and the letter to Mr. Millhiser says, ""Although you may already have been notified, please note that on Wednesday, September 19th, CBS Reports will premiere its new season with a show titled The Teenage Smoker. The attached flier from CBS outlines the subject material on the show. I think you will agree it is a it people airing Philip is potentially a hot one, which you and your will want to see. Best regards. Leo Burnett Company."" Is that correct? Yes. Okay. So nine days or so in advance of the of the CBS Reports program on teenage smoking, Morris, Incorporated was made aware that this was about to happen? on live the pre Yes. j And in advance of the show actually airing television, a telegram was sent by Joe Cullman, sident of Philip Morris, to James Aubrey, president of CBS Television? to look I believe it was the same day. I would need ; at the dates. I Sure. You have I Let me just hand it to you. You have an advantage here of having them. ji (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6146 for i.d.) \",
"You know, that's fair. I do. And that is PT6146.",Okay.
"And let's just read this for the record, and then I'11 ask you a few questions about it.",Okay.
"So we have a Western Union telefax from Philip Morris to Mr. James T. Aubrey, president, CBS Television. Does that look correct?",Yes.
"And it's dated 9-19-62, September 19th, 1962?",Yes.
"Okay. It says, ""Wish to express my keen disappointment at the editorial imbalance in the CBS Reports show scheduled for tonight titled The Teenage Smoker. An attempt should be made to tell both sides of this important question, and we are shocked to find that this has not been done. The public deserves to 0 know about the accumulating weight of evidence that favors the industry's position. 2 The program as shown on closed circuit to your affiliates yesterday is so biased that it 4 constitutes a distinct disservice to millions of 5 smokers and to one of America's basic industries. Joseph F. Cullman, III, president, Philip Morris, Incorporated. Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did. :"
"So a couple of things that are apparent from this telefax is that Philip Morris and its, at least its president, if not other individuals with the company, had the ability to see the program on closed circuit before it aired live on TV.","Yes. If it was shared with affiliates, \ yes I"
Right.,it seems that way.
"Well, and from the tenor of this telefax it seems obvious Mr. Cullman saw this program",Yes. \
before it aired that evening scheduled to air that night?,Yes.
"And he says that he feels that the program that is going to be shown is, what is the word? Sorry. Trying to find it.",Imbalanced? Is that what it was? Let's i see. :
So biased?,"Oh, so biased. : Okay. ""...so biased that it constitutes a distinct disservice to millions of smokers and to one America's basic industries."" That was his position for the company. (sic) said - I mear"
And then within that broader context there was also a discussion within the program about smoking and health?,That was my impression.
"Okay. Understand. And in addition to Mr. Cullman well, let me ask you this. The program, the transcript that you reviewed, did you gather from your review of that transcript of the CBS Reports program that they were talking about the danger that cigarette smoking posed to teenagers?",Yes.
"Okay. So in response to having seen that program, Mr. Cullman on behalf of Philip Morris before that show airs on CBS Television that evening sends this telefax and says that this is a excuse me ""The program is so biased that it constitutes a distinct disservice to millions of smokers and to one 0 Americas basic industries.""",
"Well, he doesn't","He doesn't say, so I don't know."
"limit it? Right. I mean, he essentially says the whole program?",
That's what he says?,I don't know what he means by his statement what he's referring to.
Okay.,"It says ""the program,"" yes."
"Well, he says the public deserves to know about the accumulating weight of evidence that favors the industry's position. You understand that to be referring to his views on the smoking and health, what I'm calling controversy?",
"Okay. In addition to the telefax from the 4 president of Philip Morris to the president of CBS 5 Television before the show was aired, there was additional pressure that was strike that. There were additional communications between individuals at Philip Morris or who worked for Philip Morris and CBS Television. Did you see that as well? Yes. j (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6147 for i.d.) \",Yes.
So this letter says,
"Henry O. Pattison, Jr. is who the author of this letter is. Do you know who Mr. Pattison is?",I don't.
You're not aware whether he is in-house counsel or outside counsel for Philip Morris?,I'm not.
"All right. In any event, he writes this letter to Mr. Aubrey. It says, ""We've just been informed that as part of tonight's episode of CBS Reports dealing with the smoking practices of teenagers you plan to use filmed reproductions of Parliament advertising material produced by us for our client, 0 Philip Morris, Incorporated. Did I read that correctly?","Produced by us for our client, so this is the producer. 4 Q. Looks like it's the outside"
"Okay. So this is from Henry Pattison, Jr. And it's obvious that it's written before the program is aired, correct?",Yes. \
"Because he says, ""We've just been informed that as part of tonight's episode you plan to use material...""",Yes. \
Okay. So he's writing this to the president of CBS before the program has even aired on television?,That's correct.
"It says, ""This will serve as formal notice to you that we expressly forbid any such use,"" referring to the Parliament advertising material, correct?",Yes. ;
"""Disregard of our wishes in this matter by you will constitute a willful invasion of our legal rights and those of our client for which we will hold you fully accountable."" Did I read that correctly? A Q Yes. ""I urge you as a reputable organization not illegally and irresponsibly misuse material owned by others which has come into your possession by virtue of trust Mr which we have placed in you."" Signed by Pattison, Jr. A Q Yes. And obviously this is a is it fair to characterize this as a threat to CBS not to air this program with this material in it?",
Right. And telling them that they forbid any use of that material?,Of that material. Not of the show not airing. They're not saying don't air the show. They're saying don't use this material that is our j; commercial material in your show.
"And they say, ""Disregard of our wishes in this matter will constitute a willful invasion of our legal rights and those of our client, Philip Morris, for which we will hold you fully accountable.""",
Correct?,That's what it says.
"And, again, that was before the program even aired, they were sort of preemptively trying get them to not use this Parliament advertising material?",
Little too late then?,It had to before. had l
"All right, Miss Bonhomme. Back on the record. Let me hand you PT6148. This is just the same subject we were talking about earlier, the CBS Reports teenage smoking program that was going to air September 19th, 1962.",Yes.
"It's a letter from Paul D. Smith, 0 vice-president, general counsel for Philip Morris, Incorporated to James T. Aubrey, president, CBS Television dated September 19th, 1962.","Yes. 4 Q. It says, ""Please be advised that Philip 5 Morris, Incorporated forbids the use of any of its advertising material by you without its permission. Such use is also prohibited by our various contracts. Unauthorized use may involve talent problems, violation of copyright, and disparagement and destruction of our continuing advertising themes. This applies particularly to commercial material currently in use. Please be further advised that this company holds you responsible for any loss or damage suffered by it by reason of such an unauthorized use, including, but not limited to, the cost of the development and production of substitute commercial material of equal quality. ""Very truly yours, Paul D. Smith, vice-president, general counsel."""
Did I read that correctly?,Yes.
"So this is another letter in advance of the airing of this program on CBS Reports, The Teenage Smoker, threatening legal action and putting CBS on 0 notice that if they use its advertising materials without permission, there will be consequences?","It seems to be that he's indicating there would be legal consequences if they used commercials i for one of our brands, yes. \"
"Right. So, again, in advance of the program \ airing, this is another action by someone either from or associated with Philip Morris contacting CBS Television and advising them against using some material that they plan to air that night in that CBS Reports The Teenage Smoker program?",Using \
"Well, you read the transcript. You said excerpts of the",Excerpts.
"Did you see in any of the experts excerpts, how they plan to use those television advertisements?",I didn't. j
You didn't see that?,I didn't see that portion.
That wasn't part of excerpts?,I didn't read that portion. :
Okay. Okay. So you're not aware how that how those excerpts or how the tele excuse me. Strike that all that. You're not aware how the advertising material that was used in the program was used,No.
when it aired?,No.
Okay. So you don't have any way to know whether do you know whether CBS complied with these legal threats?,
"Okay. Let me show you PT6149. It says at the top, ""Telegram received September 20th, 1962, 9:10 a.m.?",Yes.
So this would be the day following the airing of that CBS Reports program?,Yes.
"And it was this is a telegram from Mr. Salant, Richard S. Salant, president of the Columbia Broadcasting System?",Yes. j
"And not to be confused, but the other letters we saw were to James T. Aubrey who was the president of CBS Television. Right?",Yes. j
"And this is from Richard S. Salant who's the president of CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System",Yes. \
"written to Mr. L.S. Matthews, executive vice-president of Leo Burnett Company, who as we mentioned earlier is Philip Morris incorporates Incorporated's principal outside advertising agency?",That's correct.
"Okay. It says, ""This is in reply to your telegram to several CBS personnel concerning the CBS Reports, The Teenage Smoker. We wish to advise you that the brief segments of commercials to be used as outlined in the documentary were all obtained by means of off-air audio records of material broadcast to the general public. The program does not include any material taken directly from commercials which you, as the agent of the sponsor of programs of our facilities, have made available to us. In these circumstances and in view of the manner in which these segments are used in the program, we do not believe there is any basis for loss or damage to you or your client or for breach of business ethics or practice."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"So essentially the president of CBS responds that, you know, our use of these advertisements was not only legally appropriate but not in any way a violation of our business practices together. Is that fair?",That's fair.
And do you understand that as a result of the airing of this program by CBS Reports that there were subsequent meetings with CBS and executives from Philip Morris?,Related to this program?
"Yeah, related to the airing of this program.",Right. There would always be subsequent meetings. Yeah.
Right. But what I'm asking is are you aware 0 that there were how you Scratch that. It doesn't make any sense. Let me just show you the documents. Here you go. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6150 for i.d.) 4 BY MR. BIGGER:,
"This is PT6150. Because whether or not you're aware doesn't is not what we're here about. Asking bad questions. All right. So I've handed you PT6150, which \ is a letter dated October 9th, 1962.",Yes. j
"And this is from James Bowling, James C. Bowling?",Yes. :
Do you recognize that name?,I do.
And who is Mr. Bowling?,He was an executive at Philip Morris. He j; had various positions throughout his career. i
Okay.,But he worked in the New York office when I knew him and he was an executive.
"And he wrote this letter to Mr. Cullman who was Joseph Cullman, president?",Yes. \
"Millhiser, which I think was a name we saw on the other letter from Leo Burnett nine days in advance advising this program was going to air?","Yes, we saw the Ross Millhiser."
"Ross Millhiser. Exactly. Green, Smith & Landry. Smith, you believe that to be Paul Smith, general counsel.",Yes. !:
"Who we saw on PT, what was that, 6148?",Yes. \
"All right. And then how about Green and Landry, do you know who those two individuals are?","Jack Landry. And Green, I don't know Green. j: I'm not familiar. I didn't look into that name for :| this document. \"
"Okay. So the letter says, ""Here is some material prepared by Hill & Knowlton that will be helpful background for the October 11th meeting with CBS. "" So obviously there's a meeting coming up with CBS on October the 11th; is that fair?",Yes.
"""The first document is an analysis of the CBS Reports show of September 19th entitled The Teenage Smoker. The second is an account of some newsmen's reactions to the CBS Reports show which indicates that newsmen believe the program supported the 'anti-industry,'"" in quotes, ""position.""",Yes. \
"""The third item is a 'briefing kit,T in quotes, ""which serves as general background on the smoking and health controversy. A full text of the CBS Reports show is available as well as a tape and a kinescope if you would like to review it prior to the meeting."" Signed James C. Bowling.",Yes. j
"Okay. So following the airing of this program by CBS on The Teenage Smoker, September 19th, 1962, meetings were arranged between Philip Morris, Incorporated and CBS and CBS?",Yes. \
Is that right?,Yes. j
"And as part of those meetings, they included reactions by some individuals who saw the show that thought that it was, as Mr. Cullman put in his telegram, biased against the industry position.",
Is that fair?,I see what it says. It appears that they're I including information of that type. i
"Right. Some accounts from other individuals who saw the program who would effectively corroborate, you know, Mr. Cullman's opinion that the program supported the anti-industry position?",Yes. I
"And then the third item is that briefing kit which is general background on the, quote, smoking and f health controversy, right?","That's what it says, yeah. |"
"So in response to CBS Reports airing a program on The Teenage Smoker, Philip Morris, Incorporated sought and perceived a follow-up meeting to go over the content of that program and to discuss the industries's position on the smoking and health controversy?",
"That's what this letter clearly indicates, doesn't it?","This letter doesn't indicate that the | meeting took place. But it indicates that in | anticipation of the meeting, they were preparing | 19 materials for that meeting. 0 Q. And part of your preparation for today's deposition, did you look into whether the meeting took 2 place?"
So on behalf of Philip Morris you're not able to address that it did or did not happen today?,That's correct.
"Regardless, we've seen now that when CBS Reports was airing a program on The Teenage Smoker that contained information regarding smoking and health issues, the response by Philip Morris was to have its president send a telegram with very stern language to have its general counsel threaten legal action for use of advertising and then to have subsequent meetings following up with CBS to further address the industry's position on smoking and health.",
"Okay. You don't think that all these documents we just looked at properly characterize the 0 situation as Philip Morris through its most senior executive, among others, writing or communicating with CBS that they were very dissatisfied with them airing this program?","They the takeaway from these documents is that they were concerned about commercial use of their material in the -- in this show. And that was one i issue. And then in addition to that, they were ji concerned that the show was biased against the I industry. And it looks to me that they wanted to have j: a meeting to discuss their perspective with CBS after j; the show aired, so that they didn't do any, anything in i terms of changing how the show aired as a result of the jj letters on the 19th. :|"
"Isn't the fair characterization of what was going on here that Philip Morris was concerned with CBS airing a program about the teenage smoker that communicated a message on the health effects of smoking differently than what the industry's position was, which at that time was there is no connection, there is no health hazard in smoking?",
"Well, I mean no disrespect but I think he quite specific in his telegram about the fact that public deserves to know about the accumulating ght of evidence that favors the industry's position. know that means the industry's position on the smoking and health issue?",
"Miss Bonhomme, in light of your attorney's instruction not to answer, I'm not going to ask you that question again. You've been instructed not to answer it, and you're going to, I'm sure, follow your instructions",
"All right. Miss Bonhomme, what I'm trying to get at here is we look at the follow-up letter, October 9th, 1962 after the program, nothing in the follow-up letter discusses the use of advertising material or the improper use of Parliament advertising, does it?",That's correct. i
"Yeah. What it talks about is the briefing kit on the smoking and health controversy, the newsmen's reactions to the CBS Reports show that they agree that it was anti-industry, and then the analysis which by Hill & Knowlton of the CBS Reports Teenage Smoker show. That's what was referred to in this letter?",Yes. :
"All right. The telegram from Mr. Cullman to Mr. Aubrey is talking about the disservice to the public by not knowing about the accumulating weight of evidence that favors the industry's position and the program being so biased that it constitutes a distinct ; disservice to millions of smokers. He's referring to the information in the program on the smoking and health issue, isn't he?",
"That's the fair characterization of this telegram, isn't it?",Just repeat of the telegram.
The fair characterization of Mr. Cullman's telegram,Let me go back. i
is that he is referring to,
"No problem. And if you need to read it to refresh, that's fine.",Okay.
"Have you had a chance to read it, refreshed?",I did.
"What I'm trying to ask you is, the concern expressed by Mr. Cullman in that letter fairly characterized is the disservice to the public because they're not hearing about the industry's view on the smoking and health question. And they're getting a biased program that only presents one side of that smoking and health issue?",
Isn't that fair?,"Again, I can't specifically say what he was referencing in the program. The program was about teenage smoking. And there was messaging about the smoking and health issue also. And I can't speak to specifically what Mr. Cullman was referencing here."
You read some excerpts of the transcript of 0 the program,Yes.
"which we've established. The program was about the prevalence of teenage smoking and the fact 4 that is it safe for teenagers to be smoking when it may cause lung cancer. I mean, that was some of the central questions in that program, right?",
"Well, did you see that in the excerpts that you reviewed?",I saw that there was topics related to \ smoking and health. I don't remember specifically them.
"And the point I'm driving to is that Philip Morris was alarmed or bothered by the fact that the CBS Reports program on teenage smoking was going to i; air and talk about smoking as a health hazard to teenagers when what they wanted was for there to be the other side in there, that it may not be a health hazard to teenagers, it may not be hazardous, there may not be hazards from smoking. That's really what was going on here, isn't it?","She was born in 1945, so she would be '55, '62, she's be about 17. i"
Right.,Yes.
"This is the Marketing Research Department Philip Morris, Incorporated, August 1970?",Yes.
"And this national tracking studies like this were things that Philip Morris, Incorporated would do during this time period in the 1970s and before this as well in the 1960s?","This national tracking study started about 1970 and is still in place at the company. It's a methodology that tracks smoker share for year after year. And so this is a unique piece of infrastructure. Separate from this, the company may have done other individual tracking studies for different purposes."
"Okay. And thank you. I appreciate the clarification. So I just want to call your attention to a couple of things in here. And, you know, it would 0 probably be easiest if there's like a if you see at the bottom right-hand there, there's like four digits after the 6131.","Yes. 4 Q. So I'm looking at four, page four, 0004."
"All right. Just looking at the type smoked by age, ""Some types are almost for ""everybody"" regardless of age..."" and then they have in parentheses ""...(menthols, 100s, charcoals). Others appeal especially to the young..."" which and then they have in parentheses ""...(filters, especially flavor filters) or the old..."" and in parentheses ""...(nonfilters, coupon brands)."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"So just the general, again, proposition that, you know, different ages, different types of brands are popular amongst different ages of smokers.",That's the general impression.
Right.,"And but keep in mind, this study is only conducted among adults."
Correct.,"Individuals 18 and older, different brands have different demographic profiles, yes."
"Yeah, so certain brands strike that. Certain brands and certain types of 4 cigarettes are more popular with younger smokers versus older smokers versus middle-aged smokers?","Well, this report is specifically speaking i about young adult smokers versus middle-aged versus l older, so, yes. ji"
"And this report specifically is talking about 18 is the bottom end of the younger smoker, if you will?",That's correct.
Okay. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1546 for i.d.),
All right. Let me show you PT154 6.,
Are you able to read it okay?,"Yep, um-hum. ;"
"All right. All right. Some of these older documents, the quality, you know, it's not always ideal, but if you can't read something and you're having a hard time, just let me know.",Okay. \
"Okay. So this is a PT154 6 document dated June 9 June 12th, 1970?",Yes.
And it's a memo from Shirley Wilkins and Bud Roper to Steve Fountaine?,Yes. I
"And at the bottom down there it says, Roper Research Associates, Inc.?",Yes. |
Roper Research Associates was an outside market research company that Philip Morris used?,"They were a marketing research public | opinion firm, yeah. |"
"Okay. All right. And Philip Morris used them for different projects as a outside vendor, if you will?","Yes, they did. j"
All right. Steven Fountaine. What was Steve Fountaine's role with Philip Morris?,"He was in the research function. I don't | know what his exact position, you know, but he worked | 19 in the marketing research function and may have had other positions at different times. I don't know."
"Okay. Now it says, ""Subject: Suggestions for research to answer questions raised on Philip Morris benchmark study."" 4 A. Yes. f",
"Now the first sentence there says, ""In our recent presentation to management on 1970 benchmark study."" previousl involved benchmark What was the benchmark study? It's not this study that you showed me y Right. It's a different study? It would have been a different study. Right. And what were the ages that were in that study, the benchmark, the study? Was that also those 18 and up, or it a different lower end? company's age and o study. I didn't see the benchmark study. But the practice was to speak to individuals of le lder . Okay. But I did not go look for the specific was gal ; In preparation for your testimony today, you didn't seek out that 1971 benchmark study? attorneys ascertain I didn't. I didn't, no. Okay. And it wasn't provided to you by your or anything else? No, because they gave me what I asked for. Okay. All right. So in an effort to the company's position on these issues and particularly on these documents, you didn't ask for that 1970 benchmark study referenced in there?","I didn't. But from reading this memo and from knowing the company's practice, I would take it that would be 18 years in age or older, but I would have to go look for the study really to, you know, be more specific."
Okay.,"But when you read this memo, I think you'll conclude"
Get yeah.,conclude that the benchmark study was among 18 and older.
"It implies that, right?",Yes.
"Fair. Okay. So let's look at this memo from Ms. Wilkins and Mr. Roper. ""In our recent presentation to management on the 1970 benchmark study, Mr. Cullman questioned the 0 6.4 percent share from Marlboro that the study showed and our explanation that the discrepancy between this share and Marlboro's actual nine to ten-percent sales share was due to the fact that Marlboro has such a high 4 percentage of its smokers among the types of young people our survey misses of necessity (on college campus "" "" (on-campus college students, those in the military and those under 18 years of age."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"So from that long sentence, we can ascertain a couple things. There was a recent presentation made ; to management by Ms. Wilkins and Mr. Roper.",Yes. :
And among the individuals who were involved in that meeting was Mr. Cullman?,Correct. \
"And this was do you know if this was Joe Cullman, III we saw from the telegram in 1962 or was this","Well, there's a Hugh Cullman also, so, you know, I don't know."
"Yeah. Okay. Hugh Cullman in 1970 was no longer, you know, in management in the company, or was he still in management?","When I joined in 19 79, he was in management. I didn't look into for today what Hugh Cullman's I positions were. :"
Okay. You didn't look into which Cullman this was?,No.
"All right. Both Cullmans, though, were in senior levels in the company? 3 A. Yes.",
All right. So they had a question from Mr. Cullman as to why there was a discrepancy between the reported share of Marlboro and Marlboro's actual share; is that fair?,"Well, I would say their reported share of I Marlboro and Marlboro's reported share from other data | sources. |"
Right. I mean the share,What j 13 Q. The share they had discovered in their benchmark study 15 A. Right.
and the share that Philip Morris had from I other sources?,Right. I
"Okay. Gotcha. 0 And he requested in that final sentence of that paragraph, he requested, being Mr. Cullman, 2 right 23 A. Yes. 4 Q. requested that research be recommended 5 which would confirm or negate the reason for this discrepancy. So a long story short, is there a discrepancy? And if so, let's confirm that or get rid of it. Is that fair?","Yeah, with the objective to get what is the real market share from Marlboro."
"Yeah, or why is there a discrepancy?","Why is there a discrepancy and more importantly, what is the actual Marlboro market share."
"Yeah. Okay. All right. So looking at you know, based on their sort of parenthetical statements there about the students or the types of young people that the survey misses",Yes.
"you know, they kind of go on this memo and they break down each of those categories. And one of the categories they have starting on page two is young people age 14 to 17.",That's correct.
"Okay. So under that section they say, ""To 0 get a reading on the smoker percentage and Marlboro share among teenagers not covered in the benchmark study, we recommend interviewing young people in summer recreation centers, beaches, public pools, lakes, et 4 cetera."" Do you see that?",Yes. I
"""This will not provide a projectable sample of people in this age group, but it has several advantages."" Do you see that sentence?",Yes. |
"All right. When he's referring to a projectable sample, what he means is that they won't maybe get enough responses to have a statistically significant projection for various uses. Is that a fair way to say that?",No. |
Okay. Tell me what a fair way to say that would be when he's talking about a projectable sample.,"A projectable sample is a sample that | properly represents the population it's trying to | 19 understand. So to have a projectable sample, you can't conveniently interview people in certain locations. | You would need to put in place a methodology that would I be very randomized, so you represent the entirety of | 23 that population, because certain types of 4 Q. Right"
Okay.,Okay.
"Would projectable there also relate to using the data for other purposes, like, in other words, the ability to extrapolate from that data and use for forecasting or leaf buying or that kind of thing?","I mean, it could. You would prefer projectable to nonprojectable. But you don't always have to have projectable data to make a decision from the information."
"To make a decision. Okay. So he's saying here's what we propose, but it's not going to provide a projectable sample?",That's right.
"All right. ""The low at-homeness of this group..."" I'm sorry. 0 ""...but it has several advantages even though it won't be projectable sample. The low at-homeness of this group combined with their incidence in households would make house-to-house interviewing quite expensive. In addition, true answers on smoking habits might be difficult to elicit in the presence of parents. We believe that the greater accuracy of answers plus the higher rate of productivity on interviewing outweighs the disadvantage of not having a projectable sample."" Right?","That's what says, right. ;"
"So even though it's not projectable, there's some distinct advantages to doing it this way?","That's what he says, yes. \"
To go and to interview these 14 to 17-year-olds at summer recreation centers?,Yes. \
"And it says, ""We suggest having..."" Sorry. He talked to the 50 locations and the interviews in each.","Yes, I see."
"And then he says, ""We suggest having the interviewers obtain interviews with those who appear to be between the ages of 14 and 21.""",Yes. ;
Right? Okay. And he explains why he extends the age limit?,Yes. \
"Well, with regard to the college age?",Yes.
"""The questioning would be along the lines as follows:"" And he kind of puts forth the questions there?",Yep.
Is that fair?,That's fair. \
"And then there's the, after the sort of questions they're going to ask, they say, ""We would have the interviewers ask the age of the respondent, but if she..."" being the interviewer, disagrees or thinks the reported age is too high, we would have her record her guess as to the correct age. This is in the event that the smokers raise their age in giving it,"" right?",Yes. \
"""And, in our opinion, this suggested approach will provide a good reading on the Marlboro share among very young smokers, as well as adding information on college student smoking habits."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"All right. So at the request of Mr. Cullman after a presentation to management, the decision was made or the recommendation was made to go out and find or validate or invalidate this discrepancy in the Marlboro smoker share.",
Right. And,"I don't know that Mr. Cullman requested a proposal from them. Seems from this document and al from having been in meetings where there's been discrepancies in share numbers at different times in career, it's usually somebody saying, Hey, what happened here."
Right.,"And then the Roper organization went off. You know, they're an outside vendor. They came back with a proposal and with an opportunity to sell this project and be paid for it."
And they did?,
"In other words, let me clarify in light of the objection. so \ my They went about the survey process that was recommended by Roper, Philip Morris did?","No, they didn't. I looked further into this, and it seemed that I saw a document from Mr. Fountaine, I believe it was the author, and I saw a documentation that they didn't go forward with it because they didn't think it would be actionable."
Okay. And do you have those documents with you today?,I don't.
Okay. But you saw some document that says that this wasn't going forward?,Yes.
But you don't have it with you today?,No.
"Okay. Regardless, Mr. Cullman was the one who requested that this proposal be put together in order to figure out why the survey is saying that they have a smaller share of market than they really believe 0 they have for Marlboro?","I wasn't left with the impression. The impression I had was that he was questioning the discrepancy between Marlboro share because, in his mind, Marlboro had a significantly greater share than what the benchmark you you rea Q A Survey report study showed. And he was saying and, \ know, when you question that share, that makes --- and if you don't think the share is right, it j: lly causes you to think about the entire study. that's an important question."
"Let me hand you PT1071. And while I'm at it, I might as well hand you PT2827. We'll start with 1071.",Okay. I
All right. Do you have the single-page document PT1071?,I do. \
"Okay. So that is a memo to the well, from the Marketing Research Department from a gentleman named Al Udow?",Yes.
And it's an Philip Morris inter-office correspondence?,"That's correct. i bottom some company don't k Dated July 25th, 1974? Yes. \ Okay. And the distribution list down at the indicates who this was sent to? Yes, it does . j; And among the other individuals, there's well, we see J.J. Morgan, for example? Yes. James Morgan? Yes. He was well, what was his role in the in 1974? '74? I Um-hum. He was in the marketing organization. I now if at that point he was the vice-president I of market, but he prior to that had a position where he ji oversaw Marlboro in the brand group. He became the ; vice-president of marketing, but I don't know exactly I what ye ar it was. Did he also didn't he also become president or CEO of the company? Yes, he did at a much later time, yes. ; But he at one time he was, I think at this time, actually, he was the kind of the person in charge see in of the Marlboro brand? That's correct. ji All right. And Al Udow, that's a name we'11 some more documents. But who is Mr. Udow? He worked in the Marketing Research j; Department in consumer research, and he was a senior i manager of the we were Roper s Roper o previou sources particu associate director. Okay. So he's writing about the highlights special Roper study on young smokers? Yes. And this is now in July 197'4? Yes. I This is a few years after the last documents looking at there that were, I think, from 1970? This is four years later. But Roper, it's the same organization. The tudy they're references hearing is that same rganization that we were talking about sly? Yes, it is. i Bud Roper? Yes. \ It says, ""There is evidence from many to suggest some new trends in the marketplace, larly among young smokers. Because of the implications, especially from Marlboro, of any change among young smokers, we commission the Roper organization to undertake a special personal interview study among a nationwide sampling of smokers up to the age of 24 with interviewing being done June 7th, 15th, 1974. Attached is our summary of the highlights of that study. Bud Roper will be here personally to put on a presentation of the findings as he sees them on the morning of August 8. Invitations will be sent out soon as soon as details are firmed up. Al Udow."""
Did I read that correctly?,"Yes, you did. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2827 for i.d.)"
"And then PT2827 is a document that is entitled ""The New Competition For Marlboro's Franchise.""",That's correct. 0 Q. And from the Philip Morris USA marketing research July 1974?
Is it your understanding that this is the 4 document being referenced in this previous memo?,It's my understanding that this is the data tied to a presentation that's going to be given.
Okay.,But this is going this talks about a presentation.
Right.,Which this isn't in a format that would be used necessarily for a presentation.
Yeah.,"But if you're asking me are they related, I believe they are related."
"Right. Like in this memo from Mr. Udow, it says, ""Attached is our summary of """,Right.
""" the highlights of that study?",Yes.
Your understanding is this is that attachment?,"It should be that attachment, I believe."
So this is the new competition for Marlboro's franchise as we mentioned July 1974?,Yes.
"All right. And so if you look at just the first page there, it's actually page two, I think, but, yeah, the first page it says, ""The problem..."" Do you see that?",Uh-huh.
"Okay. So ""The problem is identified as for the past year Marlboro's growth in share of market has slowed down considerably. Marlboro Red in particular has shown evidence of loss of momentum."" That was the problem they identified?",Yes.
"And at the bottom it says what was done there, and they say, ""The Roper organization was commissioned to undertake the study summarized here with the intention of probing the dynamics of the market among the smokers below the age of 24."" And in parenthesis it says, ""(This was not the usual, quote, 'sample' of age 18 to 24. In this study no lower age limit was set.)"" Close paren. Right?",Yes.
So they did they're doing they recognize there was a problem with Marlboro's growth and share of market slowing down. And so they commission the Roper organization to undertake a little bit different study than they had done in the past. Is that fair?,No.
"Okay. A, That's not fair",
I'm just reading from the documents. So tell me why it's not fair.,"It's different from the usual study that's been done across the organization, I think. I don't think. It says usual sample of age in this study no so this was not the usual. Not just for Roper."
Right.,"This was not the usual sample for all of the research that's done, which would include that Consumer Tracking Study you showed me quite a while ago, the 1970 tracking study, so they're saying this is unusual for the general business practice of the company. I don't think he's saying this is just unusual for Roper."
Okay.,I think there's a big difference.
Okay. All right. And I appreciate the clarification. I do.,Okay.
"So the problem is Marlboro's growth and 0 share of market was slowing down. And what was done, the Roper organization was commissioned to undertake the study summarized here, which, as you pointed out, was not the usual sample of age 18 to 24. In this 4 study no lower age limit was set.","That's yes. which is Okay. And so if we look at the next page, 3, 2827-3 at the bottom, at the top there it says, ""Young smokers were sought out in 35 locations around the country at popular, quote, hangouts, at drive-ins, bowling alleys, near military bases, at beaches, provided et cetera. The resulting 1,050 interviews data that match the more carefully controlled ji sampling procedures of the National Tracking Study."" Did I read that correctly? Yes. Okay. And so like it shows down there in the chart there's the 18 to 24 '74 tracking study, which is right like the we looked at the 1970, I think, Yes. National Tracking Study? And then there's this study which is age to done by Roper? Yes. All right. So if we look at the next page of this document under findings Can I just have one second to just I Sure. Okay. All right."
"Yes. So under findings, findings number one there, ""The rapid growth and Kool's share..."" Kool is a brand of cigarettes that's made by Brown & Williamson?",Yes.
"Which is now part of R.J. Reynolds, but that was a competitor brand to Marlboro?","Yes, it was."
"""The rapid growth in Kool share and the slowing down of the rate of growth for Marlboro among young smokers is shown by this study to be closely interrelated and not just coincidental."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"So they were showing there was well, you know, the title of this highlights is the new competition for Marlboro's franchise. And, in essence, you know, the new competition is their Kool is what 0 they've come to find out.",That's what they're questioning and trying to learn about.
"Right. So among the other findings that 4 they have about the switch from Kool to Marlboro, that movement, if you go to page seven at the bottom right-hand corner 2827-7",Um-hum.
"for example, in finding five, they say, ""The most important reason is young smokers give for settling on their first regular brand..."" And that's what they're looking at here is what is these young smokers' first regular brand; is that fair?",Yes.
"So the most important reason given is what we might call peer pressure. In their words they say, like, ""My friends/schoolmates smoked them; 'everybody...'"" in quotes, ""...smoked them,"" and, ""My parents smoked them."" You see that?",I do.
"And by far, you know, my friends and schoolmates and everybody added together is much larger than what their parents smoked?",Yes. 0 Q. Okay. And so that's what they're saying is that the important reason for this first regular brand choice is peer pressure; is that fair?
Right.,"So if you're a teenager and your friends are smoking, and you haven't tried it, you're going to get a cigarette from them. You're going to get the brands that are popular with your peers."
"Urn-hum. And as they recognize there, you know, this tendency to go with the leader or to smoke the most popular brand, it feeds on itself because that just makes it more popular and it's like a self-sustaining sort of machine at that point?",
"Well, I mean",And then I see the statement here
Yeah.,"in this one study, but I can't come to conclusion that that's an accurate assessment of how things work."
"You don't think that the idea that, you know, as a brand became more and more popular with a segment or this younger smoker segment that it would sort of feed on itself? In other words, as the popularity grew, it would become more popular. And if kids are going to smoke what's popular, then they're going to smoke that brand? You don't see that cycle?",
"I mean, what I'm saying is you don't agree with that cycle?","I don't know enough to assess that cycle because all of the work that I did with regard to brands was in among adults. All the work I did with the company was adult smokers or adults. And so I don't have enough information to answer that question. From the work in youth smoking prevention, the company understands that peer influence is the most important factor in why young people experimented with cigarettes. 0 Q. The Youth Smoking Prevention Department, did that all start '98; is that right, is that when that began?"
The Youth Smoking Prevention Department?,Right.
Okay.,"Prior to that there were initiatives in various departments. So in '98 they put it all together and expanded the role of with a, you know, people dedicated to working in youth smoking prevention."
"Well, we're just so you understand, we're focused today on this period of time during Miss Lourie's lifetime and during this, you know, 1970s, 1960s, '50s, the documents we looked at so far. And so what I want to ask you about is so for Philip Morris, the company's position on this issue that, you know, based upon the bulk of the work by Roper that was done to assess this problem of Marlboro's share of growth slowing, their recognition that, you know, the most popular brand and peer pressure are those most important influences for that first regular brand and 0 that as a brand becomes more popular that it sort of feeds itself, that tendency to go with the leader. That was Philip Morris's understanding of this problem at that time?",
"Well, did the company think the opposite? I mean, did they think that the less popular a brand was, the more it would sell?","I don't know of the company having a point of view on all of this. You know, you'll see things written in reports, and individuals have points of views, and they have insights, and they have they do analyses, and they think things. But everything that an individual thinks when they do a study doesn't ladder up to the company having a point of view."
Okay.,"I mean, if the company has a point of view, it comes from multiple sources."
"Well, I want to see if this one laddered up 0 to use your words.",Okay. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT6024 for i.d.)
6024. I'm sorry. I I don't want to hand it to you. I think he wants it look at it first.,
"So the 1071 that we looked at, the short memo from Al Udow attaching this highlights on the 10 Roper work was July 25th,",Yes.
"right? Same day what I've just handed you, which is PT6024, July 25th, 1974?",Yes.
And this is Al Udow to James Morgan?,Yes.
"And the subject of this is, proposal for further research on Marlboro and Kool trends. 0 A. Yes.",
"So this is another sort of letter detailing 2 some thoughts on this work that the Roper organization did different than their usual work, 18 to 24. This 4 was the, let's look at the younger smokers under 18. 5 MR. GERAGHTY: Objection to form.",". Is that fair? I mean, this is a proposal. And And I was just trying to put it in context. I just want to make sure that Yeah, please."
"Sure. I'm just what I'd asked you was, this relates to that same research that we looked at already, the work by the Roper organization.",I think this relates to the same problem that the slowing of the momentum of Marlboro and the increased interest by Kool smokers than Marlboro and that it certainly was the topic in the Roper memo.
Right.,So it certainly relates to the concern about Marlboro's Marlboro's momentum slowing.
"Yeah. I mean, let's just read it. That 2 will probably help. Then we can talk about it.","Okay. 4 Q. ""The current Roper report on young 5 smokers..."" which is we referred to ""...documents the existence..."" underline ""...of the problem of Kool eating into the Marlboro franchise and puts dimensions..."" underlined ""...on the size of the problem. We need to go further into the matter in order to come up with a "" "" with direction for what to do..."" underline ""...about the problem. It is the purpose of this memo to recommend a program of research to lead to action recommendations."" Did I read that correctly?"
"So the same thing, Marlboro losing share to Kool among these very young smokers. And Al Udow says that this memo is to recommend research to lead to action recommendations?",Yes.
"So and then he says, first he starts out, though, it says, ""Why the current trends? There are these hypotheses:"" So there's A, B and then one and two under B. So A, ""However right the marketing 0 approach for Marlboro in motivating young people in the past, it might be less right, less relevant in the present. ""B, Kool might be doing something even more 4 right for these young people in these times."" And then under B you have one and two. ""This could be the result of some specific marketing activity of Kool's or it could be the product of a sociological development into which Kool happens to fit."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"All right. So based on what Al Udow knows about this issue, however right marketing was in the past for motivating young people to smoke Marlboro, it may be less right, less relevant in 1974 where we're seeing our share decline?",
Is that a fair characterization of what he's saying in here?,I think the characterization is what he's saying is here or here's my thinking on what might be some of the reasons for Marlboro's slow slowing down momentum relative to Kool among young people. I think that's the essence of what he's saying. 0 Q. Right. Here's my theories.
"Here are my ideas, right?","Right. 4 Q. Okay. And, you know, maybe Kool has some new marketing activity that's increasing their share or maybe it's just that times have changed and that what Kool offers better fits kids, these young smokers today?"
"That's essentially what he has under one and two for Kool, right?",Right. But the previous study was individuals up to age 24.
Um-hum.,"So I think he's referencing young people. I don't know necessarily if he's tying this back to a specific segment. But, yes, I think that he's saying, hey^ here's some things that I think."
"Right. And that study up to age 24 was different because the usual study with 18 to 24, this one had no lower age limit, right?",Usual study was 18 and older up to.
"Right. The one they reference in there was 2 18 to 24, that segment. This new Roper one is up to age 24 with no lower age limit, right?",Right. But the usual studies are 18 and 5 over.
Yeah.,And but then he pulled out the data for the 18 and 24-year-olds in this document.
"Right. This is different, though, in what Al Udow is talking about here in PT6024 is different because it's a study that doesn't have a lower age limit, right?","I thin he's proposing new studies, yeah."
But he's talking about that Roper study that didn't have a lower age group?,"Oh, yeah."
Yeah. That's what I was trying to get at.,I think so.
"So he says, ""In a sense, then, these brands project different self-images. Marlboro equals freedom, independence, grown up, out from under the apron strings. Kool equals a rejection of the classical societal patterns, a rebellion. Not just cutting loose from the family but rejection of the 0 society that was built by the parents."" You know, that's how he's describing Kool.",That's what he thinks. Yep.
"So if you go to the second page, then, he 4 has kind of what to do. So this was the why the 5 current trends section. The next page has the what to do section.",Okay.
"""It would be easier if we would credit Kool's advertising with being the underlying cause of the phenomenon. Judgment says that Kool's advertising is essentially bland and descriptive, at least graphically, rather than being directed to the market movements noted here. Thus, it is not a case of designing new Marlboro advertising to counter effective Kool advertising."" Correct?","That's what it say, yep."
"Yeah. So he goes on to say, ""We are probably faced with the difficult problem of designing a whole new marketing strategy to counteract what may well be a cultural phenomenon. This is no easy task."" Right?","Right. So he's saying, don't just change the advertising. Change all the marketing programs, I think."
Right. It's not just it's not just as simple as running a new advertising campaign?,"Right. 4 Q. Would it be right and possible for Marlboro somehow to communicate to young people that it is aware of the current culture climate of the young smoker and that it is more representative and symbolic of this lifestyle than any other brand? Would a Marlboro with such an image capture more first brand smokers, more switchers in later on, hold smokers against switching away? Would it avoid alienating Marlboro's current smokers including the older ones? Would such an approach be compatible with the current Marlboro image? Could it be used in parallel with the current campaign?"" So some of these things he's just posing questions, right?"
"But when he's talking about it, what he's looking at is he's looking at if we did this, if we have a new marketing strategy, would we capture more first brand smokers. Right?",I think that's one of the questions he's asking. I think he's looking much more broadly than that.
Yeah.,H e ' s k i n d of coming up w i t h d i f f e r e n t thoughts on what he would think or important questions to be answered.
"I mean, the problem they've defined is that Marlboro's losing share of market to Kool. Right?",Yes.
So Marlboro's share is decreasing?,"No, Marlboro's share is growing more slowly."
"Okay. That's a fair way to put it, right, better way to put it, it's growing more slowly?",Um-hum.
Its growth rate is decreasing?,Yes.
"Okay. And so, you know, that growth rate, there's three sort of sources for that growth rate. Marlboro smokers can be first brand smokers. Marlboro can be the first brand they smoke and they stay with it.",(Nodding head).
"Marlboro could gain switchers, people who smoked Kool or something else and switched to Marlboro?",(Nodding head).
"Or they could keep people smoking Marlboro and not switch away. Those are the sort of the three ways that their growth, their share of market can grow, right?",That's -- that would be correct. i
"Right. And so an approach that he details down there below is having three concurrent campaigns for Marlboro, right?",Yes. j
"And looking at the campaigns, he's got the using the cowboy as it is for Red. Don't change a winner, except possibly younger cowboys, right?","That's what he say, yeah. jl"
"Number two is, ""Women and young people showing Marlboro 100s and Lights.""",Yes. \
"Number three is, ""Young men, aged 25 to 30, not cowboys, informally dressed showing Green only,"" right?","That's what's written here. This is his j suggestion, yes. ji"
"And Green is Marlboro Green, the menthol brand?",Yes. ;
"The Red is Marlboro Red, the full flavor Marlboro filter?",Yes. \
"So the reason we look at this document and the point that I want to see if you agree with is that Philip Morris was concerned about this declining growth rate in Marlboro, right?",Yes. They were concerned. They were interested in understanding the slowing down or the momentum of Marlboro at this time.
"And after doing some work with Roper, it appeared the problem was the younger smokers, the ones under 18 who they weren't capturing before and changes going on with that segment of the market?",
Let me show you PT5054. Okay. Have you had a chance to see it?,I've seen it.
So this PT5054.,Yes.
"It's an analysis of Marlboro Menthol, which is the Green, right?",Yes.
In Grand Rapids?,Yes.
"And we can go through the document section by section line by line. But would you agree with me that this document recognizes that the success of Marlboro Green in this market in Grand Rapids, September 1974 is due to the number of teenagers that are smoking its brand?","It suggests that that's a factor in the success, yes."
"I mean, it suggests","In this particular market, yes."
Right. It suggests that it's the most significant factor?,"That's what it suggests. I don't know if it, in fact, is because this is an individual who went to a few stores and wrote a memo about that experience and came to a conclusion. 0 Q. Right."
"Well, let's look at just a couple sections, I guess, then.",Okay.
"So under the findings there's a number of different sections down there, right?","I mean, right, they're yes."
"He's just got numbered paragraphs or numbered sections, if you will, looks like five of them. Six.",Yep.
"Yep. So looking at number two there, store type and location, he says, ""Of the seven supermarkets I visited, not one showed any great movement of Marlboro Greens."" The supermarkets, right?",Yes.
"""Most of the stores showed only one column of Greens in their cigarette section (cartons).""",Yes.
"""On the other hand, all of the convenience stores I checked indicated Marlboro Menthol moved very well. And the store located closest "" excuse me "" close to high schools said its movement was exceptional."" Right?","Yes. That's what he wrote, yep."
That's what he says?,Yep.
"If you look at the next page, he cites a specific example there. He says, ""A specific example..."" At the top.",Oh.
"""... of Marlboro Greens' success in convenience store outlets is shown by a store located near a high school reporting both Marlboro Green and Red movement at 60 cartons a week each, while Kool, 13 which is the overall market leader, was moving at cartons a week. ""Also, the..."" And excuse me. And if you look above that, he says that in the supermarkets the average was 24 cartons a week of Greens. I'm sorry. Strike that. 18 cartons a week for the supermarkets. But 0 this one store that's located near a high school is selling 60 cartons a week of the Greens and the Reds. 2 MR. GERAGHTY: I'm I think you drew the wrong comparison there. The 18 is referencing Kools, I think.",
"I think that well, let's look at it. Okay. So the sentence kind of carries over on both sides. But if you we'll read that sentence, the bottom of the first page.",Okay.
"It's talking, again, like we mentioned, the that the 14 convenience stores were doing exceptional movement. The supermarkets, not one showed any great movement of Marlboro Greens, right?",Yes.
"And this is verified by the fact that of all the stores visited, the convenience stores which had much less traffic than supermarkets order on the 15 average of 24 cartons a week of Greens compared to cartons a week for the supermarkets, right?",Yes.
So the supermarkets are only ordering like 18 cartons a week of these Greens?,Right. Yes.
"But a specific example of Marlboro Greens' success in convenience store outlets is shown by a store, one store, located near a high school, reporting 4 both Marlboro Green and Red movement at 60 cartons a 25 week each. So 60 cartons of Marlboro Green and cartons of Marlboro Red, right?",Yes.
"And then he says, Kool in that store was only moving 30 cartons a week.",But I don't conclude that all those cigarettes were being purchased by young people
Sure.,just because it was near the high school.
You're right. That's a fair point.,But it is that's what the store is selling.
"But they're selling 18 cartons a week in the supermarkets, and they're selling 60 cartons a week at the store located near the high school, right?","Well, sure. The convenience store trade class is much larger than the supermarket trade class in the cigarette category."
But what I'm pointing out is is that the one near the high school is the one that's selling cartons a week.,Yes.
Right?,"week? No, they buy a pack a day. I' m sorry. Excuse me. A pack a day. Thank i; So I It could have been the your math doesn't work. That's fair. And I'm not trying to it . it wasn't an effort to try and do anything than the fact that most of the sales were packs, not cartons."
Thank you.,And that's
"If you look at the next one down, type of consumer, I think we'll get some more clarification to your point that they weren't all, you know, who knows if they were all high school, right? It says, ""It was evident from the location of the convenience stores doing the best Marlboro Green business near high schools that the majority of the sales were to teenagers."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"Okay. ""I was told..."" ""In the information I received from the proprietors of these stores strengthened this view. I was told that almost all Marlboro Green being purchased was being purchased by teenagers while Red and Kools were doing well among all age groups with whites and Kools doing exceptionally well with blacks. In no instance did a convenience store report Greens being sold in any great number to people above college age level."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes. So and that is exactly the point I was jj making, because teenagers can be 18 and 19. They're jj not necessarily not necessarily underage. So I jj wanted to make sure that you properly interpreted this. j"
"It could be that this one store near the high school was selling all of these Greens to college students who happened to just frequent that store who were over the age of 18, right?",
Right.,So I was just making the point that j
Yeah.,"you can't assume all of those, the sales j from one that all are in h Marlboro store just because it's near a high school i of those sales are going to individuals who ji igh school. Okay. Okay. j He did say, ""I was told that almost all Green was being purchased by teenagers."" Right? Right, who could be 18 or 19. \ Could have been. Yep. \ Maybe it was all 18, 19-year-olds, right?"
"""Probably the greatest influence on young people to smoke Marlboro Greens is other young people. Marlboro Red is very strong here, as it is nationally with the young, and the peer group influence has played a strong part in directing teenagers toward a Marlboro brand."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"And that's similar to what we were looking at earlier in the document from the highlights on or I forget which one it was, but the document where it talks about the fact that tendency to go with the leader, go with the popular brand feeds on itself, that kids teenagers, excuse me, will smoke the most popular brand most commonly?",
"They can also get them from vending machines at this time, right?","At this time, there were vending machines."
"Yeah, let's look at number six, the next page, under vending.",Next page under vending. Okay.
Top under six. Yeah.,Um-hum.
So at the end of that paragraph,Yeah.
"it says, ""Areas with little student traffic will carry at the most one column of Greens, while areas with heavy student traffic will show multiple columns."" Did I read that correctly?",And can we go back to see where he was where the vending machines were located?
"Well, I think it's saying areas where there's heavy student traffic, students being high school students.","Okay. Yes, you read it correctly."
Okay.,I'm with you.
Yeah. So the point being is just that in the areas where there was heavy student traffic they were selling a lot more Marlboro Greens. They had multiple columns in those vending machines.,"Yeah, that's what it says. You know, so just so we put this document in the proper lens, someone from Philip Morris in New York went to Grand Rapids and spent two days and went around, visited stores and came back with this information."
"Um-hum. The conclusion, let's just look at the conclusion there.",Okay.
"So conclusion, Marlboro Green is very highly edge segmented. Its sales are almost exclusively to teenagers, and it is possible these teenagers are switching away from Greens before entering the college age level, which would account for Green sales dropping off greatly when outside of a high school area. However, more time is needed to track the teenagers during this age transition. The teenage market is very changeable. And although Greens are strong in Grand Rapids now, it can change without warning. One store owner..."" parentheses ""...(located near a high school)..."" close parens ""...pointed out that a 0 salesman from Lorillard came by passing out Newport samplers of 4s to the students, and since then his sales of Newport went from 2 to 15 cartons a week. ""I feel that students will stay loyal to a 4 brand due to peer group influence, not because of the brand itself. This makes for an uncertain market. ""I also feel that Marlboro Reds are not being hurt by the success of Greens in Grand Rapids. Most of the Marlboro Menthol market is comprised of teenagers who for the most part are probably new smokers rather than brand switchers."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"And then at the bottom you can see this wasn't just, you know, his memo that he kind of stuck in a file. You know, this was from the Marketing Research Department to Mr. Fitzmaurice from James Spector, and it was CC'd to, among others, you know, James Morgan who we saw down at the bottom there. You see that?","Yes, I do."
It's got R.B. Seligman who was the director of research and development?,Yes.
And a senior vice-president?,Yes.
