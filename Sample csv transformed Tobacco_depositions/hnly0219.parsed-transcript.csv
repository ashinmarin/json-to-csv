question,answer,Declarative_Text
Altria does not manufacture cigarettes itself; right?,"PM USA is the only manufacturer of cigarettes. Q department? A Q Does PM USA have its own separate R and D No Do you know when that responsibility was, I will say farmed out, I don't mean that pejoratively, but allocated to Altria Client Services?"
And that's when the change occurred?,Yes.
"You understand you are under oath this morning, just like you would be in a trial?","I do, yes."
"And you are authorized, and, in fact, you have been designated by PM USA to speak on the subject matters contained in your disclosure; correct?","I certainly come here and offer my testimony as an expert and fact based on my disclosure, if that's what you mean, yes."
"Right. I mean you are authorized by Philip Morris to appear here, you are here under PM's auspice and at their behalf; correct?",
"But so the record is clear, is it your understanding you are authorized by Philip Morris to discuss the subject matters that are listed in your disclosure in the Danielson case?","I don't know if I would say I was authorized, I was certainly asked to discuss these matters."
Are you on any medications that might affect your memory or your ability to answer questions?,No.
Is there any other reason why your memory or ability to answer questions might be impaired this morning?,"Other than getting old, no."
"All right. I am right there with you. You have given a number of depositions. If I ask a question you don't understand, please let me know and I will try to rephrase it, and if you don't ask for clarification, we will assume that you understood the question. Okay?",Absolutely.
You graduated from college in 198 9?,Yes.
You went to work for the American Tobacco Company out of college in 198 9?,I did.
And can you briefly describe your work history since that time.,Since 1989?
"Yes, sir.","So I was with the American Tobacco Company for about 5 or 6 years. During that time frame, I worked within their research and development facility. My work generally was associated with what we would call reduced ignition propensity cigarettes, development of cigarettes in general, measurements of cigarettes, so a variety of different things during that 5 to 6-year time frame. I started with Philip Morris USA in 1995, again, I have always been in research and development, more specifically at Phillip Morris, product development. I have been in a variety of different groups, and what I have been able to do since 1995 is work in different areas of cigarettes. I started with filters, worked on paper, tobaccos, total design, measurements, testing, so the whole realm of what we consider cigarette product development, and so today, as my title tells, I lead the development of our cigarettes for Philip Morris."
"In your opinion, are the cigarettes, the Marlboro cigarettes specifically that Philip Morris commercially produces today any safer to human health than the cigarettes they produced in 1995, the year Lamar Danielson died?","In my opinion, I don't know how I can answer that question. I don't know how."
All right. Is it your testimony or has it been in the past that you work on safer cigarettes or making cigarettes safer?,"All through my, what is that, 24 years or thereabouts I have been working, those projects that I went through in one way, shape or form were projects that were looking at reducing the risks associated with cigarettes and cigarette smoking."
"Have the risks associated with cigarette smoking been reduced in the 2 4 years that you have been working in the industry, and I am speaking specifically to risks to human health from smoking?","The best way I can answer that in my opinion is if you look at cigarettes, maybe I can't really associate it in that specific 24-year time frame, but, certainly, if you look at the science, if you look at the literature, cigarettes have a reduction in risk with the advent of filters and other design changes, but I certainly can't associate it with that 24-year period."
Have you ever made a public statement -- Strike that. Have you ever made a statement on the issue of smoking and health that was intended to be heard by people outside of Philip Morris or your immediate family?,"No, I don't know of any such statement."
I saw in your CV you presented to standard setting institutes while you were at American Tobacco Company. Can you tell me briefly what that entails?,"Yes. That presentation was to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and it was about a method to measure in a laboratory the potential for cigarettes, this was associated with cigarette ignition propensity, so it was around the method development."
"I take it, you were born, by your graduation date at least, sometime in the mid '60s thereabouts ?",Correct.
Have you ever heard the message when you were growing up -- Did you grow up in the USA?,No.
Where did you grow up?,I was born in England.
"And where did you spend your formative years, say up to age 12?","In England. And when did you first move to the United Q States? A Q I was 14, 1981. All right. Let me ask you, did you ever hear the message, from the time you arrived in the United States into your college years, that smoking could cause lung cancer?"
Did you ever hear the message that it was not a proven fact that smoking caused lung cancer?,I'd heard messages like that or read information like that.
"Which of those messages, if either, did you believe?","In my belief, my belief, ever since I was a young kid, was that smoking was dangerous, smoking caused disease, it was a message it was told to me by my parents, my grandparents, and that had been my belief, still my belief today."
Had you ever heard of the Tobacco Institute from the time you moved to the US until you began working with the cigarette industry?,"The only -- Let me be clear, the only time I heard of the Tobacco Institute was after I was working for a tobacco company."
"Good. Thank you. If you recall, when is the first time you ever heard of the Tobacco Institute?","I don't know. I don't '89 to '95, I knew it before I started with Philip Morris, I had heard about it."
Had you ever done work that you knew to be work performed on behalf of or in affiliation with the Tobacco Institute?,No.
"Did you ever meet anyone whom you knew to be, at the time you met them, an officer or an agent for the Tobacco Institute?",No.
What about for the CTR?,No.
"I looked at a number of cases you have testified in. I was wondering if -- and you know, I don't want to cast the net too wide, but if the basis for your expertise for the opinions that you give is materially different today than it was two or three years ago, are you still basing your opinions on the same well, if you will, of expertise?",Let me see if I can best answer that.
Sure.,"I mean my opinions, my testimony is based on, obviously, my training, my knowledge, experience. You said you have read some of my other depositions, et cetera. And so science does move and new publications come to bear, but it is still that same -- I think you said the same well of information, so my material, excuse me, my opinions haven't changed in that time frame."
Okay. Your former testimony has included testimony on Philip Morris's current and historical positions on smoking and health; correct?,Yes.
Including disease causation in humans?,Yes.
"PM's position on that, to be clear.",Yes.
PM's position on addiction?,Yes.
Both historically and currently; correct?,Yes.
"Also, on the issue of publicly communicating the harms caused by smoking, you have testified on that at trial; correct?","I have touched on that. I would say that is not an area that I -- I am not in communications, but I have certainly talked about some of those aspects."
"Were you aware, during your time as a scientist at American Tobacco, from '89 to '95, I guess, that American Tobacco claimed no one had proven that smoking caused lung cancer in humans?","I don't recall exactly what American Tobacco's position was during that time frame. I certainly know that it is the different -- well, American Tobacco doesn't exist today, obviously, but I certainly know that it wasn't a matter of they accepted the definition associated with how we say that smoking causes disease. Exactly what their position was, I couldn't tell you."
"Were you aware that during your time as a scientist at American Tobacco from '89 to '95, that American Tobacco claimed nicotine was not addictive?","Yes, that would be consistent with my recollection."
"Were you aware, when you began at Philip Morris and afterward, that Philip Morris claimed no one had proven that smoking caused lung cancer in humans?",Say that one more time. I just lost you on the time frame.
"I am going a little fast, and if I go too fast for either one of you, feel free to let me know.",Okay.
"Were you aware, when you began at Philip Morris and afterward, that Philip Morris claimed no one had proven that smoking caused lung cancer in humans?","I certainly realize what our position was as a company, smoking was a risk factor. But the evidence wasn't there of causation as far as demonstration of mechanism, and that was the science foundation that Philip Morris's position was based on."
"So the answer is yes, you were aware that Philip Morris denied there was proof that smoking caused lung cancer; correct?","I don't know if I would use the word denied as much as I would say what I just answered as far as our position on smoking and health was based on the scientific foundation, that the mechanism by which disease was being caused by cigarette smoke had not been shown. That was the science position that Philip Morris had taken, certainly recognizing during that time frame that smoking was a risk factor in these diseases."
"And when Philip Morris changed that position, that was not a change based on science, correct, that was a policy decision on the part of the company?","You are correct, there was a positional change of Philip Morris for numerous reasons about 1 9 9 9 ."
"So t h e s c i e n c e i n 1998 was n o t m a t e r i a l l y different from the science in 1999, Philip Morris just decided, as a corporate position, that it would admit that smoking caused lung cancer in human beings; correct?","You are right in saying that it was a positional change in '99, to agree that smoking caused lung cancer, yes."
And there was no material change in the underlying science that you or Philip Morris could point to to say that is the reason for the change; right?,"There was no scientific breakthrough in that time frame. As I said, it was a positional change that Philip Morris adopted."
"Did you, as a scientist working at Philip Morris, believe Philip Morris's position at the time that you began there, that is?","Just so we are clear, are you asking me did I in 1995?"
"Yes, sir.","Okay. Thank you. I understood their position, I really did. As I said, I'd always believed that smoking was a risk for disease, I always believed as a kid that smoking was dangerous, but I understood the science, the foundation by which Philip Morris's position was built on, and I understood that in '95, so I accepted it as a science foundation, I still had my own beliefs though."
"Well, I guess that's what I am trying to tease out. Were your beliefs, as a scientist, the same as the position articulated by Philip Morris as a company at the time you began working with Philip Morris?","As I said, my beliefs -- let me use my beliefs as a lay person, okay, because my beliefs started before I was a trained scientist. I certainly understood their position, I understood American Tobacco's position, and certainly accepted the fact that that was built on a science foundation, and so I understood that position, and it was a factual position."
Right. Did you agree with it?,I agreed that it was a factual scientific-based position.
"Now, my question is did you agree with it substantively. I understand you looked at Philip Morris's position and you said I understand the scientific basis for Philip Morris's position, you have just told me that; right?",Uh-huh.
"My question goes one step further. ""When you analyzed Philip Morris's position, which you just told me you understood, did you agree with it or did you disagree with it?",I agreed with it.
Okay. Did you change your mind at some point about whether it was merely a risk factor versus an actual cause of disease in humans?,"No. Let me be clear again. I mean the position I agreed with was, you know, I will retell what I said, their position was built on science, where the mechanism of disease was not known, I certainly agreed with that, that's a fact. I certainly agreed that smoking was a risk factor, and I agreed with that. So that is where my agreement comes. Now, my beliefs, like I said, had always been that smoking was dangerous."
"Dangerous enough to cause lung cancer in humans? A Q Absolutely, yes. The first part of the answer, that's true today, correct, that smoking is a risk factor and that we don't understand the specific mechanism; is that right?","You are correct, and then, again, that's why in '99 it was a positional change to agree with where the public health was, to get back in step with where the public health was, for numerous reasons which, again, I do agree with."
"Are you aware that when you began at Philip Morris and for several years afterward, Philip Morris claimed that nicotine was not addictive?",If you can ask me the question again.
"Sure. Were you aware, when you began at Philip Morris -- let me just stop there, and I will cut out the afterward. Were you aware, when you began at Philip Morris, that Philip Morris claimed nicotine was not addictive?","Philip Morris's position was based on the fact -- in that time frame, so I started in '95, just so we are clear, '88, the definition of addiction had changed, the criteria had been loosened up tremendously by the Surgeon General and others, and so Philip Morris's position was that it really contested the standard by which addiction was defined. Okay. I mean they certainly understood the standard before '88, they certainly understood the standard post '88, and their position was really a question against the standard associated with what demonstrates addiction. That was our position until about '99."
Right. Have you seen the testimony of the executives in the Waxman hearing where they put their hands up under oath and say I believe nicotine is not addictive or some variation thereof? 16 A So you are talking about the testimony?,
Yes.,"Yes, I have seen that."
"All right. So you were aware, when you came in '95 -- Had you seen that before 1995?","Yes. I saw it live, I guess."
"Okay. So you were aware, before you came to Philip Morris, that Philip Morris's -- the head of Philip Morris at least took the position under oath that nicotine was not addictive; right?","Yes, and certainly during that whole hearing -- I mean what you are talking about is kind of the sound bite that gets played on occasion. And certainly, when you listen to all the testimony that Philip Morris through their scientists had made, explaining why they didn't believe that cigarettes were addictive and that the definition that they subscribed to or we subscribed to as a company was really the pre-'98, so it was really clear what their position was."
"Let me mark -- I will go ahead and mark this as number 4, I haven't gotten to 1 to 3 yet, but as long as we are on the subject. NOTE: Page 14 from 1988 Surgeon General Nicotine Addiction report was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 4.",
"This is an excerpt from the 1988 Surgeon General's report, which you were just discussing. I have taken some of the chapter conclusions and specifically page 14 out of the report, and I want to look at number 2 under Chapter IV, Tobacco Use as Drug D e p e n d e n c e . F i r s t o f a l l , t h i s i s t h e same r e p o r t y o u w e r e just referring to when you said the definition of addiction had changed in '88; correct?",Yes.
"An excerpt from the report, to be clear.",Yes.
"It states under number 2, Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. And that's true, correct, true today?",It certainly is believed by many that nicotine plays a role in addiction for some of those people who are addicted.
"Right. Philip Morris's position today is that if people want to know about smoking and health issues including addiction, they should go to public health authorities including, for example, the Surgeon General; correct?","So we are clear, Philip Morris's position is for people interested about smoking and smoking health should get their information from the public health community?"
"Yes, sir.",Of which the Surgeon General is considered part of that public health community?
Correct. That's correct; right?,Yes.
And the Surgeon General today takes the position that nicotine is at least a drug in tobacco that causes addiction; right?,"I think that is -- a pretty decent representation of where the Surgeon General is, yes."
"Okay. And that was true in 1998 as well, when this was written, right, that nicotine was the drug in tobacco that caused addiction?",Let me read this. May I take a couple of minutes to read this chapter?
Absolutely.,"Can you give -- This is kind of the introduction part of the report, isn't it?"
Correct.,"It is a summation of the conclusions, if I remember correctly."
Right. This is a statement of the chapter conclusions that are given after each chapter as you go through the report.,Thank you.
"Okay. And back t o my q u e s t i o n , I am reading the first sentence again, nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. That was true in 1988; correct?",That was true as far as the Surgeon General's position.
"Well, it is a true fact, is it not? I mean you just told me it is true today, nothing has changed about nicotine and cigarettes from 1988 to make that somehow untrue in 1988; right?","As I said, certainly a lot of studies have been done with nicotine and its effect on addiction and it is probably the most studied constituent in smoke and the most agreed to, if you will, constituent that plays a role in addiction."
"Let me ask you this way, because this is the way I will ask you at trial: The Surgeon General said in 1988 nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. That was true then and it is true now; right?","From the Surgeon General, yes, yes."
And Philip Morris agrees that that is true today; correct?,We c e r t a i n l y a g r e e t h a t c i g a r e t t e smoking is addictive and we certainly realize that nicotine plays a role in addiction.
But Philip Morris does not today agree that nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction?,"I would say that there is no question that nicotine is in tobacco, nicotine plays a role in addiction and nicotine is considered by some as a drug. It doesn't meet all the definitions but I don't want to quibble about that. So I don't know if we have got a position on that as far as Philip Morris, I can just tell you what I know our position is at Philip Morris and kind of add what I think about it too."
"And to be clear, my question is about Philip Morris's position.",Yes.
"When you said it plays a role in addiction, it plays a causative role in addiction particularly; correct? It being nicotine.","You know, I don't know the answer to that question. I mean certainly addiction is not an area I study, appreciate that, so when you say nicotine plays a causative role, I don't know the answer."
You don't know whether nicotine causes addiction?,"You are asking mechanisms associated with addiction, and I am just telling you, clearly, that is not an area I studied or an area I can really offer opinion against."
"Okay. Well, you just told me nicotine plays a role in addiction. What role did you have in mind when you said that?","Maybe I don't know the role in a scientific mechanism, I don't. So when you say it is causative, I just don't know the answer to that question."
"No, I understand. You just told me that. My question is when you said nicotine plays a role in addiction, I am curious what then you meant by a role, what role does it play?","I mean we know cigarettes are addictive, that is clearly Philip Morris's position. We know nicotine is in cigarettes, continue that logic, and nicotine, as I said, plays a role. Now, how it plays the role, I guess that's what I am saying to you, I don't know."
Then how do you know it plays a role?,"I guess from reading what the literature says, okay."
"The second sentence says specifically, nicotine is psychoactive (""mood altering"") and can provide pleasurable effects. That is also a factually accurate statement; correct?","That's consistent with my knowledge, yes."
"Right. And that was a factually accurate statement in 1988, when it was made by the Surgeon General; correct?","Yes, evidently."
"The third sentence, nicotine can serve as a reinforcer to motivate tobacco-seeking and tobacco-using behavior. That is a factually accurate statement as well; correct?","Again, this is the statement of the Surgeon General."
I understand.,"Right. As I said, you are starting to get away layers of my knowledge and -- I can't answer that question either, whether it is motivation or behavioral aspects. Again, I certainly agree that nicotine plays a role in addiction, but now we are starting to get deeper and deeper, and I am not going to be able to offer you kind of my trained opinion on that."
Do you have any opinion about whether menthol acts as a reinforcer in cigarettes?,I have not seen anything that would suggest that to be true.
Is it your opinion that it does not?,"In my opinion, I don't think it does, no, again, from the science that I have read on that matter."
Is it your opinion that -- Do you have an opinion as to whether acetaldehyde is a reinforcer in cigarettes?,"I have certainly seen research around acetaldehyde and its potential role as a reinforcer. I think it has got the potential to be a reinforcer, the question that the science -- where the science is is at the level at which it is in cigarettes, is it a reinforcer, and that's the question."
"And so back to my first one, on menthol, it is your opinion, I think I just heard you saying, correct me if I am wrong, that menthol does not -- let me phrase it this way. Menthol does not enhance the addictiveness of cigarettes; correct?","That is, from what I have read on this topic, that's my opinion."
"Okay. And you just told me nicotine is far more widely studied, particularly its association with addiction than menthol; correct?","Yes, I think that's correct in saying that nicotine is more associated with addiction than menthol, or maybe I am not understanding your question."
"No, it is a bad question. I guess really my point is this, you have an opinion, I thought you might, on menthol given, you know, what is going on with the FDA and how it -- the role it plays or not in addiction, and I don't understand how you can have an opinion about menthol, about whether it plays a role or does not play a role, and we are talking about causation in addiction but not have one about nicotine, which you just told me is far more widely studied than menthol.",So now I am really confused.
"Okay. It is your opinion -- I will break it down. It is your opinion menthol does not play a causative role in addiction, you just told me that; correct?","Compared to non-menthol cigarettes, that's what I have read and that's what the science says."
Right. And what I don't understand is how you have the expertise to give that opinion about menthol but you don't have the expertise to give an opinion about the causative role or not that nicotine itself plays in cigarettes.,"So maybe -- let me see if I can play it back to you a little bit, and I will be repetitive, but you can tell me where we fall apart on this. No question, nicotine plays a role in addiction for some people, no question about it, heavily studied to your point in its role in addiction. Okay. I see the other question as a little bit different. You are asking me does menthol change the addictive potential of cigarettes."
Yes.,"And my opinion, from reading the science on that, is no, it doesn't change the addictive potential of cigarettes."
Does nicotine change the addictive potential of cigarettes?,I don't know how to answer that question because cigarettes are products with nicotine in them. I don't know of cigarettes without nicotine.
There have been cigarettes without nicotine; correct?,"There have been cigarettes with low nicotine, but I don't know of a cigarette without nicotine."
"Then let me ask you that question. Does a cigarette with higher, relatively higher nicotine change the addictive potential of a cigarette as compared to one with very low nicotine?","Again, from what I have read on this matter on a relative scale, I have not seen any information in any science that would say that one cigarette, regardless of its design or nicotine level, is any more or less addictive than another cigarette. In conclusion, as our position states, cigarettes are addictive, period."
And nicotine is addictive?,"Yes, it is."
"And what does addictive mean in that statement, you told me our position is cigarettes are addictive or cigarette smoking? I may have misheard.","Cigarettes, cigarette smoking, I see them as the same thing."
"When Philip Morris articulates that position, as you have just articulated it to me, what does the word addictive mean in that sentence?","It is consistent with, if you will, the ADA definition criteria associated with addiction, 8 cigarette smoking meets that definition from the change in definition by the Surgeon General."
Which would include the fact that nicotine is a reinforcer to motivate tobacco-seeking and tobacco-using behavior; correct?,"It could well be that, yes. Again, I am trying my best to answer your question, you are just asking me levels around addiction that I just don't hold myself out as overly knowledgeable or studied in that area."
"No, and I understand, and I don't want to go beyond the contours of your expertise, but when you articulate Philip Morris's position such as smoking, cigarette smoking is addictive, I am just trying to explore, and I have seen you give that testimony at previous trials, so it is clearly something you feel confident to discuss. I am just trying to figure out what it means when you say that, and I understand you have just told me addictive in that statement means as per the 1988 Surgeon General's report; correct?","Per the change in definition of addiction, yes."
"Right. Which, again, includes the fact, I think you just agreed, as we can see in the '88 report itself, that nicotine can serve as a reinforcer to motive tobacco-seeking and tobacco-using behavior.",
"When you say that it includes as per the 1988 report, I am asking does that include this sentence?","Again, I don't want to confuse kind of summaries of conclusions of chapters with what is the definition standard for addiction. Does that make sense, Mr. Schultz? I don't know if this sentence means it is a solid part of the definition, that's why I am kind of reluctant to kind of give you my opinion because I see it outside of my area. So definitionally, whatever that definition is for addiction, we agree that cigarettes meet that standard. I am not saying -- excuse me. I don't believe that this is part of the definition. Do you understand what I am saying?"
I think I do.,Okay.
We will talk about it a little more --,Okay.
-- later on. Did you review any documents in preparing for the deposition today?,"I have reviewed, I think you have got them in front of me, these documents."
"The notice, the disclosure and the reliance list?",Yes. NOTE: Second Amended Notice of Case-Specific Discovery Video Deposition Duces Tecum of Defense Expert Richard Jupe was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 1. NOTE: Document entitled Defendant Philip Morris USA Inc.'s Amended Expert Witness Disclosure was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 2. Document entitled List of Materials Reviewed by Mr. Richard Jupe was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 3.
"Those are marked as 1, 2 and 3 to the deposition, and that's the extent, the full extent of the documents you reviewed in anticipation of testifying today?","That is true. I did look at a couple of documents associated with my reliance list, as I typically do."
Anything that was specific to Lamar Danielson or the Danielson case?,No.
What was your purpose in reviewing the interrogatory answers?,"When I come to trial, I always like to understand a little bit about the smoker. Sometimes in depositions, trial, I get asked about the type of cigarette that the smoker smoked, and so I would like to understand that. But really, the information that is important to me and some of the deposition -- some of the testimony I give is around that cigarette in some cases, so I typically look to see what that smoker smoked."
"And as I understand it, I just heard, Mr. Jupe, it is your understanding you won't give any -- in fact, this is a question I had later in my outline anyway -- any testimony specific to Lamar Danielson or his family?","No, I will not."
"In reviewing the interrogatories and all the materials that you reviewed, is it your understanding he smoked Marlboro?",It is.
Did you see any reference to him smoking any other brand of cigarettes?,"No, I don't think there was anything, maybe a here and there, but it seemed to be Marlboro."
"Let me ask you, I want to go back before the time you ever gave your first deposition and ask for you, in whatever way is easiest, to ball park the amount of time you spent preparing to become a witness in these cases.","So you are talking in general, you are not talking about this specific case?"
"Correct. Reviewing documents, meeting with lawyers, whatever it was you had to do to gear up, if you will, to testify for the first time.","The way I think about this is that I have been doing this since the first day I worked for tobacco is I have been building my knowledge base, and a lot of the testimony that you have evidently read is associated with what I do for a living, so the design of cigarettes, the materials, the ingredients, et 11 cetera, the smoke, is something that I have done for years. Okay. Had I met with attorneys before I went to my first trial? Absolutely. That was really a matter of --"
"At some point someone came to you, I presume a lawyer or someone within the company, and said we are going to need you or, if you will, we would like to have you testify in these Engle cases; correct?","Generally, that's it, yes."
And do you know what year that happened?,I am trying to replay the history first. Late -- late 20 0 6 maybe.
"Had you testified before that, by the way? I mentioned Engle cases. For all I know, you have testified before then in tobacco cases.",I think on page 16 --
Of Exhibit 2?,Yes. I think the first time I gave some form of testimony was in 2008.
Okay.,I think that's right. So it was maybe 2006.
"So, for example, a couple of witnesses at RJR who -- vice presidents who sort of testify in the same capacity as you do told me they set aside a half an afternoon every Friday for, you know, six months, just to meet, talk about litigation, go over documents. You didn't do anything along those lines to prepare?","I would say my conversations was ad hoc, it wasn't as routine as what you just explained."
"All right. Have you, in preparing to testify, ever undergone, and, again, I don't mean this pejoratively, but a mock cross-examination?",I don't know how to answer your question.
"Fair enough. Look, here is -- let's see if we can agree on the ground rules. I am not allowed to know anything -- the substance of any conversation that you have had with attorneys for Philip Morris, you know, external or internal, and I was going to say I don't want to know, of course, I would love to know, but I don't want to find out. The fact that those conversations has occurred is not itself privileged, so when I ask you if you have ever undergone a mock cross-examination where someone asked you questions and someone pretends to cross-examine you, I don't even care if it is lawyers doing it, I am only asking about the fact, I don't want any content of anything that has been discussed.",
Can you tell me the date you first became aware of the Danielson case specifically?,"I can't tell you the date exactly. I want to say it was in the spring, April time frame."
Of 2014?,Yes.
"And we just established, you are not going to -- let me make it clear, you are not going to give any opinions that are particular to the Danielson case alone; correct? Let me ask it this way. Strike the last question. Do you intend to give any opinions in the Danielson case that you are giving only because it is the Danielson case and you wouldn't give in any other case?",My opinions will be consistent with the opinions I have shared in other cases. I certainly don't intend on offering any opinion about Mr. Danielson.
So do you intend -- and we may have an answer to that as well -- to talk about historic nicotine and tar deliveries in Marlboro cigarettes over time?,"Look, I mean when I put this expert disclosure together, these are the types of topics. What I am going to be asked to do at trial, overhearing what you just discussed, it appears that I am only going to be doing paragraph 2. I don't determine that, obviously."
Your expertise is in cigarette or includes cigarette design and product development; correct?,Yes.
"That includes historical development and design of cigarettes, regardless of whether you will be talking about it at trial; right?","Yes. Historic, yes."
It is within your area of expertise?,"It is, yes."
You are an expert in the use of ingredients in cigarettes?,Yes.
Have you reviewed the -- Strike that. Have you ever been involved in any studies or experiments at Philip Morris using human beings as subjects or participants?,"Well, I'm trying to think of the time frame. Philip Morris has conducted studies that has human beings involved in it. I have not conducted those studies. Does that make sense?"
"Yes, sir.","Okay. And we published against a lot of those studies, but I have not myself run a study like that."
"Let me ask you the same question. Since your tenure, involving non-human animals, animal experimentation not involving humans, has that been carried out by Philip Morris since your tenure?",Yes.
Have you been directly involved in any studies or experiments of that sort?,"I -- again, for these type of tests, animal studies, biological studies or in some cases clinical studies with people, I do not run, design or operate those studies. I may be developing cigarettes in support of those studies as prototypes or ingredients that we want to get approval for, but I don't have a direct involvement with how those studies get designed or executed. Does that make sense?"
Yes. Is there a behavioral department within R and D at Altria Client Services?,"I wouldn't call them a behavioral department, no."
What is the closest analog?,"Well, we have a health science research department that would conduct these types of clinical studies or animal studies or biological studies."
"Do you have one or a branch or a division or people within R and D that specifically study, you know, psychology of smoking? Let's start with them.","We have different disciplines of individuals on the staff. Whether we study psychology or we have a psychologist, I am not exactly sure, but it is all part of that health science research branch."
"If you have an organizational chart, if you have R and D -- are you at the top of that R and D?",No. No.
Who is at the top of that?,That would be the chief technology officer.
Who is?,"Jack Nelson, John Nelson."
"I will never remember this, if I don't do it this way. I am going to draw one out for myself. If I get something wrong -- I am not allowed to make you draw things, so I am not going to ask you to draw something. But I have got John Nelson at the top, where it is Altria Client Services, R and D; is that right?",Correct.
Who is underneath Mr. Nelson?,Me is one of them.
Okay. Who else?,Our engineering department.
All right. So engineering. Who is in charge of that?,Mark Cruise like a cruise liner.
"What is engineering in a sentence, what do they do?","Basically, that role is the development of machinery for the manufacture of cigarettes, if you will."
And so we have engineering. Product development?,Smokable product development.
Okay. What else do we have?,Then we have product development associated with smokeless.
Who is in charge of that?,"James Strickland, S-T-R-I-C-K-L-A-N-D."
"Are Mr. Strickland and Mr. Cruise, are they on the same level as you are organizationally?",Yes.
They both report to Mr. Nelson?,Yes.
Is there anyone else at this level?,Then you got the head of our analytical sciences.
Who is that?,"Gerd, G-E-R-D, Kobal, K-O-B-A-L. So that is the R and D and E structure."
And is health science research under analytical?,"No. It doesn't fall under R and D. If I had known that up front, I could have saved you some time. It is a completely different branch."
And who is in charge of that?,That would be James Dillard.
Do you know Mr. Dillard's expertise or his background?,"I don't know his training or his background. Sorry. But he is our regulatory affairs, product integrity and health science research."
This is also Altria Client Services?,Correct.
"So you have -- Let me go up a level. Altria Client Services, was that all one division, regulatory affairs, product integrity and health science research?",Yes.
And that's level with?,R and D.
R and D. And E you called it?,"Yes, R, D and E, research, design -- excuse me. Research, development and engineering."
Is there another --,Under ALCS?
Correct.,"We have a lot of groups under ALCS as far as a service group company. Just as an example, our law department falls under ALCS, finance falls under ALCS, HR falls under, procurement comes under ALCS."
"How about cigarette related, specifically cigarette related like the analytical or the regulatory or what have you?","Those two groups are really -- R and D is, obviously, the research and development, just as its name states, and then health science research, then you have -- those are really the science groups, if that makes sense, Mr. Schultz."
"Right. You may have told me, but who is in charge of health science research?",That was James Dillard.
"And analytical sciences, what do they do?","They are the individuals who develop methods, run methods for assessing cigarettes, tobacco, smoke, et cetera. Analytical methods."
"Is there anyone in that structure, the entire structure we have just described it, to your knowledge, who is studying ways to reduce the addictiveness of Philip Morris cigarettes?","So when we think about that, there is a couple of components to that whole element. If you think about what we discussed earlier as far as cigarette smoke and nicotine, the role of nicotine, we have people -- we just published a paper associated with high/low nicotine cigarettes and how people smoke them, so -- and that comes under our health science research branch. So we constantly look at trying to continue to build our knowledge associated with smoking and nicotine. We also realize that the FDA has expended a lot of resources in understanding smoking and addiction, and, you know, obviously, we support FDA in this area because we do need the standard setting body to understand if, indeed, there is a way, because currently nobody knows how to remove the addiction of the cigarette, so you really do need in science a standard, and that's what we are looking to the FDA for, to develop and establish a standard, if indeed it is possible."
I am going to unpack that a little bit and make sure I understood. No one right now scientifically speaking understands how to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes?,That's correct.
And no one will understand that until you have a standard?,"That's my belief, yes. You don't know how to remove addiction unless you can have a standard for saying addiction is on less or off."
And y'all are researching that?,FDA is researching that.
Is Philip Morris or --,No.
ALCS?,"No, we are not looking at developing a standard for addiction, no."
"If you have to have a -- well, okay. So you are not working on developing a standard. Are you doing any other work that could be characterized as attempting to reduce the addictiveness of Philip Morris cigarettes?","As I said, we still study and understand the effect of nicotine and how people smoke cigarettes. Just talking about one of those papers, like I said, we just recently published, looking at the effect of nicotine in the body, we have done those types of studies. So absent a standard, absent a standard to determine addiction, then there is nothing that I think we can really do up until now until we understand what that standard looks like."
"So if I understand, you are studying nicotine and continue to study nicotine but not reduction of addiction as such because that's not possible; is that fair?",I wouldn't say it is not possible.
Not scientifically feasible given the absence of a standard?,"Almost. Without a standard, you don't know if you are successful, I think we agree with that. Unless you know what the goal is and what the number is, you can't reduce anything, you can't change anything without measuring it is kind of the principle we follow here. I mean, you know, we -- we talked about nicotine, its role in addiction. We have developed cigarettes over the years with essentially no nicotine in them, we have commercialized those cigarettes, okay, and we were told to take them off the market because they were more dangerous than regular cigarettes, so you can see kind of the conundrum that we face in that without a standard, if we were to try and do something, we would be accused of doing something wrong, and that's a fact because we were."
Was the marketing of a nicotine-free or virtually nicotine-free cigarette an attempt to reduce the addictiveness of Philip Morris cigarettes?,"When we developed those products, okay, when we designed those processes, it was pre-1988, okay, just as we discussed earlier today, cigarettes did not meet the standard for addiction. The whole work that we have done on removing or reducing nicotine was because it was believed nicotine had a negative role in cardiovascular, so the denic cigarettes as we called them, they had been in development for 20 plus years, the development of a method to remove the nicotine, and we had gone through different stages of trying to do this in a way that was commercial, repeatable and didn't leave you with a pile of mush type of thing, and it wasn't until the '80s that we were able to do that. Okay. So -- but it was driven out of the '60s, '70s and '80s by cardiovascular, okay, but -- I mean I think we will agree that, to the extent that public health says nicotine and addiction, nicotine's role in addiction, you can look back and say well, if any cigarette was going to be less addictive based on what the public health is thinking, it would have been that cigarette."
"But that was -- Because my question went to Philip Morris's purpose and motivation. Their purpose and motivation, the company's purpose and motivation was around reducing cardiovascular risk, not reducing addiction; correct?","That is correct, when that project started."
"And I assume that or infer that because Philip Morris does not have a standard around addiction today that it can apply in working to reduce the addictiveness of its cigarettes, it has never had a standard; right?","No, no standard has ever existed, no."
"Okay. Who, in your opinion, at Altria Client Services or anywhere within the Philip Morris family or Altria family would be the most qualified to talk about the role that nicotine plays in addiction in humans?","You know, I don't really know. I would --"
If you had that question -- I am sorry. Go ahead.,I would have to consult.
"Well, let me ask you this. If you had a question and said look, I want to know something about nicotine pharmacology, who in the company would you pick up and ring?",I would probably consult with the head of health science research.
Is that Dillard?,"Dillard, yes."
You are aware that Philip Morris has assessed nicotine dependence in some of its studies on humans?,"Yes, we have."
Including -- you have what was the big one called?,Total Exposure Study.
"Total Exposure. And when Philip Morris accesses nicotine dependence of study participants including in the Total Exposure Study, Philip Morris routinely uses the Fagerson test to assess dependence; correct?","The Fagerson nicotine cigarette dependence test seems to be one of the standards, there are other standards, of course, but during that Total Exposure Study of testing an individual's level of addiction, that was the standard."
Is it your understanding it is only to test an individual's level of addiction?,"I would -- better -- better serve to say if they're addicted or not. Again, not being trained in this area, but Fagerson nicotine dependence test."
"All right. And, obviously, Philip Morris would not use the Fagerson test in its own work if it did not believe in the validity of the Fagerson test; correct?","I mean we have certainly made clear that Fagerson is a good test. You know, when it comes to a standard for nicotine, going back to what the FDA is looking at as far as the nicotine threshold level, you know, can cigarettes at nicotine level X be less addictive, that's the kind of standard we are looking for the FDA to establish. Okay. Now, whether they use Fagerson or the other host of tests, I don't know, but they're the ones we are looking at to be the referee, the rule maker, the standard maker on this topic. Now, Fagerson appears, from my read and my knowledge, to be a good standard, but for determining of a individual, but is it what the FDA would establish, I don't know."
"Right. My question is about Philip Morris. In your experience as a scientist at Philip Morris, Philip Morris, when it carries out scientific studies, they're intended to be high quality science; correct?",Yes.
State of the art science?,We try.
"Right. So you would believe, would you not, that if Philip Morris applies the Fagerson test in assessing dependence in its own studies of human smokers, then the Fagerson test must be scientifically valid; correct?",
Or at least Philip Morris believes it to be.,"We certainly -- ALCS certainly, on behalf of Philip Morris, made comments on the types of methods, Fagerson being one. Forgive me for not knowing the other acronyms associated with these dependence tests. These are all published accepted tests for nicotine dependence. Okay. Again, I am not sitting there disputing the efficacy of the Fagerson test. But just so we are clear, we certainly look at the FDA that has got to be that referee, that decision maker, as to what that standard and what those test methods look like."
"Right. Philip Morris didn't ask the FDA, when it did the Total Exposure Study, what test for assessing dependence Philip Morris was to use, did it?","Not to my knowledge. I know we have consulted with others prior to the study, I couldn't tell you if FDA was one of those."
"I understand you may not know, I just wanted to make sure there is no suggestion in your response that the FDA told Philip Morris to use Fagerson in that Total Exposure Study. That's not what you intended to say; right?","It certainly wasn't my intent, no."
Do you consider yourself an expert in pharmacology?,No.
Psychology?,Nope.
Statistics?,I wouldn't call myself an expert. I can get through but certainly not at a Ph.D. level.
Advertising or marketing?,No.
Medicine?,"Medicine, no."
Epidemiology?,"No. I am c e r t a i n l y n o t an e x p e r t and n o t s t u d i e d t h a t a r e a . I c e r t a i n l y work w i t h e p i d e m i o l o g y , I have worked with all the people with these types of degrees, but just so we are clear as far as my standard, I don't see myself as their expertise. I can understand the topics, but certainly not to the other people's levels."
Have you ever read the Engle decision?,A legal document?
"Yes, sir.",(Shaking head).
Court opinion?,No.
Have you ever read testimony that you knew to have been given in an Engle case in Florida of another witness?,Of another witness?
"Yes, sir.",No. No.
Have you ever read any opening or closing statements from any cigarette case?,I have been present in the courtroom for closing statements. Does that make sense?
"Yes, sir. I have marked the depo exhibit, or excuse me, depo notice as number 1. I think you have already told me you reviewed that before the deposition; correct?","The notice of deposition, yes, I have."
And there was an exhibit attached to it asking you to bring certain materials. You have brought in your file --,
"But otherwise, that's the extent of your file; correct?",Correct.
"If you look over on Exhibit 1, I am not going to walk through the Exhibit A at the back of that and ask you about everything, I do want to make sure that we understand one another, that all of the facts and data, not background knowledge, not education, training, but facts and data upon which you base your opinions are included in the reliance list that we have marked as number 3.","To the best of my ability, yes."
"The index of reliance materials, you have got about, by my count, roughly 270 documents on this list. Did you hand pick all of those documents?","These are all documents that I have read over the years associated with smoking and health. I think there are -- 99 percent of these are documents that I read, have read and chosen to read. There are some documents that I had asked for information so, for example, the Hatch statement in '97, I didn't know where to find that so I asked for some help in some of those documents, just to use an example, if that makes sense."
It does. Types of documents included on your reliance list by my review include published scientific literature pertaining to smoking and health,Correct.
-- going all the way back to Wynder/Graham and Doll?,Correct.
"Internal Philip Morris memos including memos on study of smoke, cigarette design, nicotine delivery and behavioral research?",Yes.
Internal presentations made by R and D to company executives?,"Yes, some."
Nonscientific articles from popular magazines?,Yes.
US Surgeon General's reports?,Yes.
NCI monographs?,Yes.
Public statements by PM executives concerning cigarettes?,"Yes. Public statements, some."
Tobacco Working Group documents?,Correct.
Maxwell reports?,Correct.
"Communications between Philip Morris and public health authorities, letters, correspondence?",Yes.
And Federal statutes?,Yes.
Those are all items that you rely upon to some extent or another in formulating the opinions that you may give in this case; correct?,You are correct.
"I want to ask you, and I will tell you we have a Protective Order in place in this case, I am going to ask you about your income because it goes to your bias as a witness, but your attorneys have the right, and I presume will invoke the right to seal any portion of the deposition that they think is sensitive or confidential. Okay?",Okay.
"Can you tell me your salary, please. a y e a r . 20 A Personal",
Do you have any stock options or ownership?,Yes.
Do you know the value of that or can you describe to me how you would determine that?,Let me think for a second. I have vested and unvested stocks --
"Okay. A Personal Confidential -- in Altria. Vested, I own about worth of stock. Unvested, I would say it is pretty close to about Personal Confidential I also have a 401 (k) that includes Philip Morris stock. I am sorry, I don't know what the value of the Philip Morris stock is in my (k) .",
It includes Philip Morris stock as part of a larger portfolio?,Correct.
Is that Philip Morris stock that was given to you in compensation for services rendered?,"I am sorry. Let me be clear, just so -- it is Altria stock, to be really clear. That was my mistake."
"No, it was mine.","We have a 401 (k) fund kind of like, if you will, like a mutual fund, I contribute to that on an annual basis, the company matches, and I allocate that against these different funds."
But there is not a separate grant -- Strike that. That's all just standard 401 (k) stuff; right?,T h a t ' s a good way t o e x p l a i n i t .
"A l l r i g h t . And t h e Person o r Personal Confidentia roughly present value of stock that you have, that was stock you did not have to purchase?","That's right, that was part of compensation over the years."
"All right. Have you owned, let's say in the past 3 years, stock in Altria that was awarded to you in a similar fashion that you no longer own? In other words, did you have some stock that you have sold in the last 3 years --","Yes, I have."
-- that was given to you? All right. Do you know the value of that Altria stock we are talking about? 6 A M a y b e Personal,
"What about your annual incentive plan, as I understand it, that is kind of like an annual bonus is what other people would call it.","Yes. I receive based on, obviously, criteria, compensation in the form of stock on an annual basis. I also receive on an annual basis a cash reward."
What was that in 2013?,A cash reward?
Is it given at the end of the year? Let me ask that.,"It is, yes. It is on a calendar year. In cash. 4 2 0 1 3 , i t w a s a b o u t Personal"
"When I say 2013, I mean end of year 2013, it may have actually been awarded in 2014, but we are on the same page; right?",We are on the same page.
Is that either notably higher or lower than previous years' annual incentive bonuses?,It is a little bit higher because it was the first year I was vice president for a whole calendar year.
All right.,"So it was -- Prior to that, I had been a director for 8 of the 12 months."
"What about the long-term incentive plan, describe that for me, if you would.","The company has a 3-year long-term incentive plan bonus, it is paid out every 3 years."
Have you received one of those?,I received one in 2014.
What was the amount of that?,That was about Personal Confidential
"I assume the one, the last one you had received before that was 3 years before?",That was the first time I had been eligible for the long-term incentive bonus.
Any other income or thing of value provided to you by Altria or Philip Morris or Altria Client Services for your work with the company that we haven't described?,"I mean I certainly have benefits, insurance and the like, --"
Yes.,"-- things like that, I get a company car."
All right.,But those are really the cash and the stock and the salary and the benefits.
Do you have any military experience?,Do not.
Have you ever been convicted of a crime?,No.
"Has any court, to your knowledge, ever refused to permit any part of any testimony you have tried to give?",Not to my experience.
Have you ever been disciplined by any licensing agency?,You will have to help me out there.
Do you hold a license of any sort?,"Other than a driver's license, no."
"All right. I am not too worried about that one. Prior litigation experience, have you ever sued anyone in your personal capacity or been sued personally?",Nope.
"Good for you. Every commercial cigarette produced by Philip Morris during, I will say between 1953 and 1995, contained nicotine; correct?","Yes, every cigarette has nicotine in the tobacco."
Is there any --,
Is there any other ingredient or additive in Marlboro cigarettes that is addictive other than nicotine?,No.
"You recognize, don't you, the FDA has designated acetaldehyde as potentially addicting under its constituents of concern or whatever that list is called? You are familiar with what I am talking about?",
Constituents of concern.,"Okay. So let's be really clear, the FDA has issued a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents, I believe there is 93 constituents on that list, acetaldehyde is indeed one of those constituents, and it is believed that acetaldehyde may play a role in enhancing addiction, I think that's how they describe acetaldehyde as a -- but realize, that acetaldehyde is not an ingredient that we add. Acetaldehyde is a byproduct of burning tobacco."
Acetaldehyde is a byproduct of burning sugar as well; correct?,"It can be, yes."
And Philip Morris -- How much of the weight of a Marlboro cigarette today is in sugar that is added to by Philip Morris?,Well
"Percentage, whatever works for you.","I -- it is a good question. I mean, obviously, there is sugar in tobacco naturally, okay."
Let's put that aside and talk about what Philip Morris adds.,"So we do add sugar to our cigarettes. Weight wise, I am sorry, I don't know how to do that math in my head, I just don't know. It is a very, very small fraction, and so when we look at -- we add sugar to tobacco, our health science research group, the toxicologists look to see if it contributes to the smoke above and beyond the burning of tobacco, and that's how we establish whether we should add an ingredient or not is does it contribute to the smoke above and beyond the burning of tobacco, and our research and our publications on that say the levels at which we add sugar do not contribute to making the smoke more toxic or more toxicological above and beyond the burning of tobacco. So yes, we add sugar, yes, the literature will show that sugar can produce aldehydes during combustion and pyrolysis, I agree with that, but it is not at a level that contributes to the toxicity of the smoke above and beyond."
"Mr. Jupe, you will agree, I presume, that there is a lot more to making a cigarette than just taking tobacco and rolling it in paper; right?","To make different cigarettes, that's right."
"Cigarettes are a complex product, a highly engineered product?","There is more to a cigarette, I agree, than just wrapping tobacco in paper. I wouldn't call them highly engineered, though. I think my cell phone is highly engineered but not a cigarette."
That's interesting. So you think a cell qun/vjMi-N phone is a more sophisticated product than a cigarette?,Absolutely.
"Well, you agree that Philip Morris knows more about the design of its cigarettes than an ordinary Philip Morris consumer would know?",Yes.
You agree that Philip Morris knows more about the ingredients contained in its cigarettes than an ordinary consumer would know?,Yes.
"Is there any reason to believe, and this is subject to the caveat about Mr. Danielson, but is there any reason to believe that Mr. Danielson knew everything that Philip Morris put in the Marlboros that he smoked?","I have no way of knowing that. As I said, I would certainly not offer any opinion on Mr. Danielson."
"You gave an affidavit about the ingredients, the secrecy surrounding the ingredients, the proprietary nature of them, if you will, in Marlboro cigarettes historically; correct?",Yes.
Can you not infer that Mr. Danielson never knew everything that was in Marlboros because no one in qun/vjMi-N the public has ever known everything that was put in a Marlboro between the '50s and the '90s?,"I agree, we preserve the proprietary nature of our ingredients, we use our recipes we use for our cigarettes as other people do for their products, okay, that's our trade secret, that's our intellectual property, and the only way to preserve it is trade secret, no other way. So, by default, I assume no one outside of Philip Morris people with access to the recipe will know exactly what is in the cigarette, if we have done our job well of protecting our intellectual property. Now, the FDA knows, by statute they're required to know, so outside of us and the FDA, I hope nobody knows the recipe because we preserve it."
"Right. And, to be clear, you have used the term recipe, I use the term ingredients. I am not talking about the secret formula and how it is put together or how much there is of this, that or the other, I am talking about just the simple fact of what is in the cigarettes, period, that is not something you would expect Mr. Danielson to have known during his lifetime; correct?",
"Whatever the reasons, that is not -31-.- b 0 / t-i i~i b ' s 's something you would expect him to have known?",I think I would have to assume he wouldn't know.
"Have you ever reviewed Requests for Admission or Responses to Requests for Admission in any case, to your recollection?",I have helped legal counsel with some topics --
And the answer is yes?,Yes.
"Okay. I want to look over at number 20, it is at page 12, there is a request made that Philip Morris USA Inc. admit the following: That Philip Morris has never publicly revealed all of the additives and ingredients it placed in Marlboro cigarettes for any of the years 1967 through 1983. There is a lengthy response. The substance that interests me will be found on the next page where it says it, meaning Philip Morris, has never been required to disclose the highly confidential specifications and formulas for its commercial cigarettes and, therefore, has not disclosed this information. That is consistent with what you just told me; correct?",Yes.
"And the next request asks PM to admit that Philip Morris has never revealed to any governmental agency or entity all of the additives and ingredients it placed in Marlboro cigarettes for any of the years 1967 to 1983. Following some objections, ultimately, it states Philip Morris USA denies this request. What is your understanding of either the time and/or the circumstances under which Philip Morris revealed to any governmental agency or entity all of the additives and ingredients it placed in Marlboro between the years '67 and '83?",I personally do not know of any disclosure to governmental agencies in this time frame. I certainly realize there were disclosures made in 1986. I just don't know of any during this time frame.
Is it your understanding that the disclosures in '86 disclosed all additives and ingredients in Marlboro cigarettes?,It disclosed all the ingredients we use in the production of our cigarettes.
"Including processing aids, filter additives, paper additives?","That's a good question. I am not sure. I can't recall. I certainly know it was ingredients as far as flavors. I do believe there were humectants on that list. The other categories, I just don't remember."
"Do you know why Philip Morris adds or added levulinic acid to its cigarettes, Marlboro cigarettes specifically, between '67 and '94?","You know, I know we took it out in '94. I have seen information on levulinic acid before. Why it was there as part of a formula, I couldn't tell you, I just don't know the genesis of why it was used, but it certainly -- from what I have seen in '94, '93, I think that's the right time frame when we took it out, it really didn't do anything, it didn't add or subtract anything."
How do you make that determination whether it adds or subtracts something?,"We do that a lot, if you have got a cigarette with ten ingredients, it is really pretty simple, you take out one ingredient and you sensorially evaluate it. Our panels can usually pick up when something is in and when something is out, and in this case, what I understand is when this was taken out, there was no effect, it didn't change the flavor, the taste or aroma of the cigarette."
What about when it went in?,"I have not seen anything as to why it went in and what it was supposed to contribute, whatever its origin was."
Do you know when it went in originally in Marlboro specifically?,No.
Do you know the decade?,No.
How do you know that it came out in '94 or '93 possibly?,"Levulinic acid is a topic that appears or comes up every now and then, so it is one of those topics I am somewhat familiar with."
"Has Philip Morris ever studied whether levulinic acid enhances nicotine binding in the brain, of any organism?","No. No. I do believe that levulinic acid, it was speculated at the right levels to help, I think some of the patents talk about smoothing the smoker, but you have to put it on there at a pretty high level. I think acids have been used traditionally in the past in roll-your-own tobaccos, but typically they're more hot in the way they smoke. Okay. So that's kind of the genesis of things like levulinic acid, but it appears we didn't use it at a level that had any impact, thus taken out, and we do that on occasion."
"Right. To my question, I think you answered it before you continued, to your understanding, you have never seen any indication within Philip Morris USA or Altria Client Services that Philip Morris or anyone on its behalf has ever studied whether addition of levulinic acid to cigarettes might enhance nicotine binding in the brain?","No, I have never seen those studies, I don't even know if they were done."
"Same question, let me broaden it to having any impact whatsoever on the potential addictiveness of cigarettes or smoking?","No, I have never seen anything published on that that I can recall."
Does PM use levulinic acid in any of its commercial cigarettes today?,No.
"Is that a policy against using it or just, for whatever reason, it is not in it?","You know, we don't have policies against using ingredients. I would say we have science to defend that it doesn't, as we were talking about before the break, whether it changes, increases the toxicity of burned tobacco, I would say that's kind of our policy drive there, that's our principal way, whether we use ingredients or not and the levels at which we use them."
"But those toxicity tests would be, for example, determine whether addition of a particular ingredient enhanced the addictiveness of a given brand of cigarettes, would they?","Not -- Again, you are asking me a little bit deeper than I am really trained to respond I think as far as my education, experience, but usually the toxicology tests do not go, to my knowledge, into addiction potential."
"So, for example, you mentioned that sugars that are added to cigarettes, and I wanted to ask another question around that first, is there any other additive or ingredient outside of tobacco -- and I am sticking with additives actually -- in cigarettes that is greater by weight than sugars in Philip Morris cigarettes?","Well, it is going to depend on the cigarette, okay, but you are certainly going to -- I mean -- water is probably going to carry the most weight in any cigarette. Menthol will carry a weight higher than sugar. But then I would say maybe sugars and cocoa and licorice would fall at a comparable level. Glycerin may be higher, humectants, than sugar."
"If you were testing, Philip Morris, for example, the toxicology of any given sugar compound, let me ask you, first of all, do you test that or do you test the byproducts of the burning, the acetaldehydes, for example?","Okay. So, if you will, we really go through a multi-step weight of evidence evaluation. Basically, you start by looking at the literature, what is known about the neat ingredient, let's use sugar for this example."
Is that done in product integrity?,Yes.
Who is the head of that?,James Dillard runs that organization.
"When you pyrolyze sugar, you get acetaldehyde; correct?","You can, at the right temperatures, that's correct."
"Which i s a c a r c i n o g e n . I f you d o n ' t know, that's fine. I am not going to ask you to admit if you are not sure.","You know, I don't remember. I know it is -- I'll call it a harmful potential, harmful constituent of smoke, but is it a carcinogen, I am sorry, I don't recall."
"And the biological testing, whether in vitro or in vivo, would not reveal, for example, if acetaldehydes that are a result of pyrolyzing sugar enhance the addictiveness of cigarettes; correct? They're only testing for acute toxicity; right?","The toxicological tests, the battery of tests that our toxicologists use look at acute effects, you are correct, but they also have to model, I think, through the chronic effects, so you are looking at dose response over a period of time, so you are also looking at this weight of evidence of the addition of an ingredient versus the non-addition of an ingredient, and that's how they weigh their decisions on these types of things. We -- it goes back to what we discussed earlier, addiction potential. We don't measure that and it is not part of our toxicological tests."
"Okay. Given the, I think, acknowledged potential that acetaldehyde may enhance the addictiveness of nicotine and/or cigarettes, smoking, I take it Philip Morris has not done anything in its own right, or Altria Client Services on its behalf, to make that determination one way or the other?","You know, I know we have looked at acetaldehyde and its effect on nicotine. Okay. There are studies that are published that look at different types of ingredients and determine do -- I will paraphrase the titles, but do ingredients contribute to the addictiveness of cigarettes and, you know, I haven't seen a study that says yes, this ingredient contributes or increases the addictiveness. I don't know of any real standard though that says cigarette A is more addictive than cigarette B. As I said earlier, cigarettes are addictive. The degree of addiction, from my understanding, is based on the individual, not the science of different cigarettes."
"When you talked about Philip Morris work in this area, were you thinking about the work from DeNoble and Mele back in the '80s or something more recent?",Okay. I have talked about a lot of studies.
"You just said specifically that Philip Morris, and I am paraphrasing, had -- you have seen studies, and I thought you said including work at Philip Morris around the question of acetaldehyde reinforcing nicotine.",Okay. If I looked at -- May I look at the reference list?
Sure.,"Then I can give you a little bit of a snapshot of that. I mean you have got documents that talk about the Evaluation of Sucrose for Use as a Cigarette Ingredient, so that's the full blown toxicological assessment."
"What is the date on that, do you know, or a reference on your list?","The date, I will give you the kind of the Julian date I think they call it, 20011003, page 9, very last item."
All right.,And I am trying to think if -- There was work that was done by the likes of Jeffrey Seeman and others around acetaldehyde.
"Yes, I am familiar with that.",Okay. So they're in there. I don't want to take your time finding them.
Did you include DeNoble's work on here?,"No, I don't think I have got DeNoble's work."
Are you familiar with that at all?,Somewhat. Somewhat.
"I asked you about Bill Farone or I mentioned his name a few minutes ago. Are you familiar with Dr. Farone, who he is?","I am familiar in the context of he sometimes testifies against us. I never knew Bill Farone, he had left the company before I got there."
Have you ever read or viewed any of his testimony?,Yes.
In the context of rebutting it or for what purpose?,
"I don't want to know anything that a lawyer has told you. If I ask you a purpose in reviewing Dr. Farone*s testimony, until your lawyer tells me a lawyer told you to do it, I don't care who told you to do it, and I am not trying to pry into what a lawyer told you or not.",Okay.
"The privilege does not protect acts, it protects communications.",
"I would rather not go there, I just want to know why you reviewed Dr. Farone's testimony, and if you can answer that question, we will move on. If the answer is well, some lawyer told you to do it, therefore, you can't answer, then we are going to have an argument for a court.",Okay. I have reviewed Dr. Farone's testimony for litigation.
"And do you know what testimony of Dr. Farone's you reviewed, what case it was in, for example?","I think I remember, and it is -- Do you need the case?"
"Oh, is it on here?","Yes. One of the cases. I will say it again, and I will preface this, I think, I think, I think it was associated with what I consider a West Virginia case."
Right.,"Number 17 on page 17, I believe that was what it was."
So that I am guessing -- Was it deposition or trial testimony or both that you reviewed?,Deposition.
And -- Okay. So was that deposition taken by defense cigarette industry lawyers of Dr. Farone?,I believe so.
"Okay. Does the name -- now I have lost his name. What is Ken's last name? McClain, Ken McClain, does that ring a bell at all?","Ken McClain was the plaintiff in that case, yes."
Right. And does that help you remember whether it was the West Virginia case?,I believe it was. I -- I won't go any stronger than that. Sorry. I can't.
"Is that the only occasion, to your recollection, on which you have reviewed Dr. Farone's testimony?","To my recollection, yes."
"Okay. Now, you told me about Jeff Seeman's testimony or work and the Evaluation of Sucrose for Use as a Cigarette Ingredient, and we mentioned DeNoble, we mentioned Farone. Is there anything else that you have read around the issue of Philip Morris work or that you are familiar with around the issue of Philip Morris work on whether acetaldehyde reinforces the addictiveness of nicotine?","No, those are the studies that come to mind sitting here right now. As I said, there is other literature outside of Philip Morris, outside of Philip Morris USA or Altria Client Services that has looked at do ingredients contribute to the addictiveness of cigarettes. Sitting here, I don't know if, A, is it on my reliance list, I don't know, and I can't recall the author either."
And it doesn't sound like something you will be talking about in this trial --,I am just trying to answer your questions.
"I appreciate it. I want to go back. I am going to talk to you about nicotine and addiction, and I understand we are on the edges at times, but I would like your opinion.",
"Throughout the -- whatever period of time you have studied in preparing to testify for Philip Morris, the Federal Government has never told Philip Morris that it had to include any ingredient in a cigarette; correct?",That it had to include? No.
"And throughout that same period of time, the Federal Government has never told Philip Morris anything it could not put in its cigarettes other than controlled substances; correct?","As far as ingredients, I mean that certainly was the charge that Congress gave the DHHS, but they have never told us to remove anything. Does that make sense?"
"It does, and I am talking about even before then. The Federal Government never came to Philip Morris and said you are not allowed to put A, B or C in your cigarettes unless it happened to be a controlled substance forbidden by law otherwise; correct?","Yes, I would assume forbidden substances, we don't use, obviously, we don't. I don't know of any circumstance where they have told us to stop using something, ever."
Or forbid you to use something --,Or forbid.
"-- in the first place? Has PM kept or anyone on its behalf, to your knowledge, kept a list of all ingredients used at every point in time in Marlboro cigarettes?","No. Well, let me be really clear. I couldn't -- I don't have a list as a file. Do we have our recipes? I think we have most of them over the years we have been making cigarettes in one way, shape or form."
"Well, so let me ask it this way: Is there any way, putting aside any resource limitations, is there any way to know every ingredient that was used in Marlboro cigarettes, ingredients and additives, between 1966 and 1994?","I am going to have to say no, I don't think we can get a hundred percent, and I will tell you why, is we may be able to go back and look at a 1954 or whatever Marlboro recipe and we will be able to see the ingredients that we have added, in this example, Mr. Schultz, I will use ingredients as flavors added to tobacco, but we have also bought what I call precompounded flavors. Okay. So precompounded flavors are systems, mixtures, if you will, made by flavor houses, professional flavor houses. Even today, me, as the head of cigarette product development, if I use a precompounded flavor, I or my team does not know what is in them because the flavor house preserves their proprietary trade secret. Flavors don't get covered in patents, they get protected by trade secret, right, so I do not know what is in there. Now, our product integrity group has to know, we have a contract with the flavor houses so they can do the appropriate toxicological assessment, and they will tell me that yes, at the level you intend to use it, it is okay or no, but they will not tell me why no, they will tell the flavor house, but they will not tell me, so we have a contractual agreement with flavor houses. Now, I know that as a present state. Okay. Going back to 1954, '60, I don't know what the communication or rather the contract was and is it even traceable, assuming that flavor house is still in business, if that makes sense to you."
"Right. A couple of questions around that. Number one, would that be the only limitation that you are aware of in terms of -- if we put that aside, you could otherwise know; is that right?",So that was the ingredients added to flavor.
Right.,"Now, if you want to talk about ingredients in all materials, you are going to have the same type of conversation, okay, because we have not always had in place what we have today, in 1950s, as an example, so, again, when we put paper around a cigarette, I generally know what it is made of, but I don't know what is used in the production of that paper. Again, that's kind of a trade secret associated with that paper manufacturer. Our product integrity group does, and so the same would apply to ingredients, okay, general ingredients, pieces used in making a cigarette. That is going to be a limiting step of getting a hundred percent of the information necessary."
How about the same question with respect to ingredients and additives that Philip Morris itself put in the cigarettes?,"Assuming we've preserved all the recipes over the years, if they're available in boxes, a lot of them are in paper, secured in boxes somewhere in our locked storage, if that can all be brought back together, obviously today, the last decade plus, we keep it electronically, but, obviously, in the '50s, it is still in paper form and different formats, different names for flavors, that it would take a lot of effort to cobble things together."
"But I guess that's really the core of my question, it is feasible to do it, I take it, although there are resource issues involved?","There are resource issues, and I am not going to sit here and guarantee I can do it at a hundred percent accuracy."
Right.,There i s g o i n g t o be gaps i n i t and tremendous r e s o u r c e i s s u e s a c t u a l l y .
"Sure. And you, as I understand it, you are not aware of any limitation along the lines of wholesale document destruction of previous recipes or formulas; correct?","No, I wouldn't call it wholesale destruction. I mean we have certainly had records retention practices for many years. Okay. I have always -- I have never struggled to find recipes. I haven't looked for everything, of course, but if there are brands that we no longer produce, I don't know if we kept those recipes type of thing, I just don't know. That's a good question."
How long have you had a product integrity group as such?,"I think we are talking about the '80s as a functional unit. I mean we have always looked at ingredients but, to my knowledge, the product integrity group is about the '80s."
"And you say you have always looked at ingredients. That was my next question. How long, to your understanding, has Philip Morris done toxicological assessments of additives and ingredients?","Throughout the years, obviously, different levels of sophistication have been applied, okay. Obviously, as assays are more effective, test methods are more effective, I have seen information, certainly from the early '80s and the '70s of ingredients that have been looked at as well as taken out of the products, so I have seen studies on those types of things."
"A good segue, are you aware of any ingredients or additives that were discontinued in anticipation of the requirement for disclosure to the Federal Government?",And you are specifically talking about 1986?
Yes.,Okay.
Or in the time period leading up to it?,Leading up to 198 6?
Correct.,No. I mean I don't know of any ingredient or ingredients that were taken out because of that disclosure.
"In 1986, that was an industry-wide list not specific to Philip Morris; correct?","I think that's right, yes."
"And that was not something Philip Morris did voluntarily, it was required by the -- by Federal law; right?",Yes.
Did not identify ingredients by brand?,No.
Did not list amounts of ingredients?,"I don't think -- no, we didn't, and I am not sure it was required."
"No, that's right.",All right. Just testing my memory here.
The list could not be publicly disclosed; right?,That's my understanding.
PM didn't voluntarily release it to the public?,No.
"Did not contain every ingredient ever used in your cigarettes, only the ones that were in use at the time the disclosure was made; correct?","That's correct, and we are talking about 198 6 now."
"Yes, sir. And, of course, the companies had advance notice that that list would be required; correct?",I guess. I don't know.
"In other words, no one from the Federal Government came knocking at the door and said show us all of your ingredients?","Bills pass through the Federal Government at quite a slow rate, so I have got to assume some things were known."
"And you have seen -- I mean it sounds like you have studied the question. I have seen documents, I am sure you have too, around the issue of ingredients prior to and in anticipation of this disclosure; right?","I have seen some documents prior to '86, but I haven't seen anything that said hey, get this out type of thing."
Right.,I think we were doing that as a practice prior to any notion of this being a requirement to disclosure.
"Are you aware of any ingredient that -- and I will stick with Mr. Danielson's case, between the mid '60s and the 1990s that Philip Morris took out of Marlboro cigarettes, ingredient or additive, because of a concern over health?","I may have the wrong timing, but I will give you an example that comes to mind. Urea was an ingredient that we used in our cigarettes, and it wasn't a factual this is a problem as much as it was it was a perceived problem, so we have actually taken out ingredients over the years and continue to do so, if there is a perceived problem. Okay. Does that make sense?"
"Right, meaning a perceived problem in the sense of like PR wise or --","There is some science -- I will give you a perfect -- urea is a good example. I heard a train. Urea is a good example in that under pyrolysis produces ammonia. Okay. I am assuming you are somewhat familiar with ammonia and its perceived role in cigarette smoke. Okay. So did we need urea in the product or can we achieve the same type of taste in other ways, so that was one of those ingredients that was taken out. Now, the perception of urea is somewhat negative."
"Right, because you are using all kinds of ammonia compounds besides urea.","That's right, so do we need urea in the product, so it was kind of a combination of things. So there wasn't a scientific data point that says this is bad as much as it was this is the perception of it."
Who knew that you were using it whose perception you were concerned about?,"I don't know by name or by function or entity who was really concerned about it, but it was taken out in the '90s at some point, after we had disclosed publicly, you know, that list in '94."
"That makes sense. So back to my question, Marlboro specifically, from the mid '60s to the mid '90s, let's say 1966 to 1995, are you aware of any specific additive or ingredient that was discontinued by Philip Morris during that time period due to a concern over human health?","Again, urea is a good example of potential, but it wasn't. Does that make sense?"
Okay. We have got urea. Are there any others?,"Coumarin has been used in cigarettes for many years and that was taken out at some point, I want to say in the '7 0s for, again, its perception of what it is."
Who knew you were using coumarin in your cigarettes in the 1970s?,That's a good question. I don't know.
"You weren't revealing that fact to anyone outside of Philip Morris, were you?","No, so I have got to assume at that point it was Philip Morris's pre-product integrity looking at this, and potentially it was known that coumarin was being used. I would dare say the things that -- there are ingredients that have been used over the years that contain, natural ingredients, that may contain structures similar to coumarin, I think tonka bean was an example, that has been known for years it has been used in cigarettes, so I just don't know enough of the history to say why did coumarin become a problem, but it was something that we took out."
"And it is your understanding coumarin was discontinued in Marlboros in the mid '70s, ball park?","I think that's right. I think that's right, mid to late '70s."
"And it is your understanding it was not over a specific concern for human health that it was removed, it was removed as a matter of perception, perceived potential harm?","That is my understanding. I mean I have certainly seen confusion of coumarin versus Coumadin, okay, but, you know, could this thing pyrolyze differently, it wasn't known, but hey, look, let's take it out. 23 Q Right. FDA banned coumarin in o r i g i n a l l y ."
Coumarin as a food additive in 1954.,I don't know that as a fact.
"Okay. You have got urea in the mid '90s and coumarin in the mid '70s. Same question, any other ingredients or additives that you are aware of that were discontinued over concerns regarding human health?",Not in that time frame that I can recall right now.
"In the same time frame , are there any additives or ingredients that Philip Morris used in Marlboro cigarettes that it thought were in any way health protective or, in other words, reduced the inherent or potential harms of cigarette smoking?","As far as flavors that we used, I would say no, that wasn't the intent. There has been studies that have been done that said hey, look, these things may reduce the biological activity after the fact type of thing, so, for example, glycerin takes up weight, contributes to smoke volume, dilutes the smoke, but it wasn't the intent to use glycerin as a diluent of smoke, it was the intent to use glycerin as a humectant of tobacco."
Right.,"Okay. So maybe there was some speculation, and I call it after the fact. We have added -- and that's true for something like triacetin added to the filter traditionally, kind of after, realized that it changed the makeup of smoke, took down things in smoke that were perceived as harmful, potentially harmful, so there have been those types of ingredient utility, but I wouldn't say there is any flavors that are added with the intent of health benefit, I think that's how you phrased it."
"Do you know whether Marlboro cigarettes, during that same time frame, mid '60s to mid '90s, when Lamar Danielson smoked them, were safer than any other cigarette on the market, first of all, by virtue of the fact that they had a filter on them?","It is certainly my opinion that cigarettes with filters, the science shows a reduction in risk compared to cigarettes without filters. Okay. There is a lot of science in there, so if you use that as a premise, then I would have to say relative to non-filters, I would assume the risk was a little bit lower."
Are you familiar with work indicating that ventilated cigarettes have a higher mutagenicity than non-ventilated cigarettes?,"I have read that. I have also seen different ways of looking at that, so I believe the ventilation all in all is a good thing in reducing the amount of smoke people take in."
And y'all are selling -- Philip Morris is selling ventilated cigarettes today; correct?,We are.
"We had urea, coumarin. Are there any others on the list, back to that question?","During that time frame, I can't think of anything, sitting here right now. Those are the two that come to mind."
Have you ever seen any document that explains the basis for PM's decision to discontinue coumarin in the use in Marlboro or any other brand?,"Not -- I have seen hey, we are going to take it out type documents, but I haven't really found, if you will, the rationale for it, I haven't seen it, I haven't really looked, to be quite honest."
"The first time Philip Morris -- well, I will stick with Philip Morris, published to the American public a list of ingredients in its cigarettes was 1994; correct?","That was the first time we published a list of ingredients we used, yes."
"And that, again, did not list by manufacturer or by brand; correct?","That's correct, yes."
"Did not identify every ingredient or additive ever used, only those currently in use at the time the list was made public; right?","I believe that was the criteria, yes."
Did not list amounts of ingredients?,Correct.
"Did not include paper and filter additives, or did it?","Some of those are additives in filters and paper, they have things like triacetin was on that list, but I don't believe everything in a cigarette was shown as an ingredient, I think it was specific ingredients added to tobacco."
Do you know if DAP was on the list?,"Yes, it was."
Has Philip Morris historically used additives to paper or filters that affect the delivery of nicotine to smokers?,Say that again.
Has PM historically used additives in filters or paper that affect the delivery of nicotine to smokers?,"W e l l , y e s , by t h e - - y e s . I mean we t a l k e d a b o u t t r i a c e t i n . Okay. S p e c i f i c t o n i c o t i n e , not necessarily, it changes smoke."
Just as part of a general reduction?,"But it is part of the general reduction, which reduces nicotine."
And is that the only circumstance under which you are aware of the use of additives to paper or filters by Philip Morris that affected the delivery of nicotine was by virtue of this general reduction?,"In cigarettes we sold, that's true."
So none --,There was a reduction.
-- that would enhance delivery of nicotine?,Correct.
None that would enhance bioavailability of nicotine?,"No, I have never seen that in commercial cigarettes."
"Terry, Mr. Sexton mentioned that there would probably be, even with the FDA limited testimony in the case, some discussion of the Philip Morris website. I would like to take a look at a page from the Philip Morris website and ask you about it. NOTE: 1-page document described as from Philip Morris website entitled Smoking & Health Issues - Philip Morris USA was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 6.",
"I have marked it as Exhibit 6. This says Smoking and Health Issues - Philip Morris USA, and you have actually testified in the past on this particular content on the PM web page, correct, at trial?","Yes, I have."
"It indicates Philip Morris USA supports a single, consistent public health message on the role of cigarette smoking in the development of disease in smokers. And that continues to be Philip Morris's position today; correct?",Where are you reading?
"In the very first paragraph, the last sentence of the first full paragraph.","Thank you. Okay. Yes, that's part of our website."
And that's part of your -- the company's official position today?,Absolutely. NOTE: 7-page document described as testimony from Hallgren case was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 7.
I am going to hand you testimony from the Hallgren case that I have marked as Exhibit 7. If you look at over at page 35 -- excuse me -- 3583.,3583.
"Yes, sir. Starting at line 3 -- Actually, we can go above that, to 3582, line 21, there is a question asked of you by a Philip Morris attorney: And so does Philip Morris today support a consistent public health message on issues concerning smoking and health and addiction? Your answer: Absolutely, and that's the messages we support here. That is consistent with what we just talked about on the website; correct? We are talking about the same subject matter there.","Yes, we are."
"And it continues: And why does Philip Morris believe that's important? Your answer: I think it's very important for smokers, nonsmokers even, to be -- having a single message, a message that's clearly stated, that message should be from one source, and that message should be from the public health community so there's no confusion whatsoever for people who smoke and the decisions they make in smoking. And you stand by that testimony today?","Yes. I believe a single voice is our position, and that is what I was trying to convey."
"And there should not be, I take it from that statement and the rationale contained in it, a competing message from the cigarette industry that is at odds with the public health message; correct?","I would say that there should not be a message that is different than the public health, because a lot of these messages, or excuse me, better stated, a lot of these topics are very laden in the science, as we discussed earlier today, and we know that the public, obviously, is not as educated in the science as people like us, so a single message coming from the public health, we support that message that people shouldn't smoke."
"And specifically, there should be no competing message from the industry because that has the potential to create confusion among smokers for people who smoke and the decisions they make in smoking; correct?","For some people, it may confuse, but, for some, it may not be listened to. Okay. So part of our position is to withdraw and have scientific debates in scientific forums."
Right.,"And so the message of the public health, even though we may not agree with their positions, we won't state that we disagree with their positions in a public forum."
Because that's the responsible thing to do as a cigarette manufacturer; correct?,"We certainly see that as an important part of us aligning with the public health community. If we are saying on one page we agree that smoking causes diseases but we are contesting some of their science as a small part of that message, we certainly don't want it to be confusing in any way, shape or form, so withdraw from that public debate is what this is saying."
And when did that become Philip Morris's position?,'99 is when I kind of chalk it up to.
"When you mention the public health community in that testimony, you are including the Surgeon General and I have seen references elsewhere to the CDC, FDA and NIDA in your testimony; correct? Would you consider those all part of the public health community?","I would consider them some components of the public health, WHO, as an example, NCI, so -- and really those government or nongovernment entities that are charged with position and policy on health for the population."
Including the Surgeon General's office?,"As I said, yes."
"I am going to mark as number 8 -- we talked a little bit about this earlier, we will talk about it at trial. I want to ask you some questions about it today.","Okay. NOTE: Document entitled The Health Consequences of Smoking - 50 Years of Progress, 18 A Report of the Surgeon General, 2014, Page and Page 148 was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 8."
"I am handing a copy to counsel. This is an excerpt from the 2014 Surgeon General's report. I want to find -- I won't preface it any further. I will just ask you if you will look over, 25 please, at page 109, and this is a 109 out of the Surgeon General's report. The first sentence under toxicokinetics and acute toxicity of nicotine states Nicotine is the major chemical component responsible for addiction in tobacco products. Is that a statement that Philip Morris agrees with?","We agree that that's the message the public should listen to, and that's what our position on our website says. If this is the message of the public health, then listen to it."
Right.,"Okay. Now, whether that is as scientifically factual as it can be, that is irrelevant, we will debate that in the science, all right, but that's the message the public should hear, that's what we agree with."
Would that also be true in the courtroom?,I don't know if -- I don't know. That's a very different question of law versus public. I don't consider a courtroom public.
No -- And maybe I wasn't being fair in the way I phrased the question. You testify in trials on behalf of Philip Morris.,Uh-huh.
And my q u e s t i o n i s do you come and b r i n g to the courtroom for jurors a different message about the smoking and health question than Philip Morris gives to the public when they're outside of that courtroom?,"No. I mean let me be really clear. Okay. I mean we have the website here. Okay. Smoking causes diseases, lung cancer and other diseases, we agree with that, that's our position. Public should be listening and getting direction from the public health including the Surgeon General and making their decision whether they smoke or don't smoke, we don't disagree with that. All right. Maybe I may disagree with some of the science, which I do, in my opinions, I agree -- excuse me -- I disagree with some of the science. Okay. And that's perfectly natural, and that's what scientists are supposed to be doing. Okay. But I will tell you what I will tell you in a courtroom is this is the message that we want the public to hear and make decisions against, and that's the messages of the public health."
"I will tell you what I will ask you in the courtroom, which is and isn't it fair for the jury in the Danielson case to use exactly the same information from exactly the same sources for exactly the same purpose?",Okay. You are asking me to make a legal decision that a jury needs to be making. I am not comfortable in responding to that question.
"I am asking you whether Philip Morris's position changes once you are in the witness chair versus the position that it takes in public, or should the jury consider the same information from Philip Morris's perspective, not its lawyers and not what the law says, from Philip Morris's perspective, should a jury consider the same information that Philip Morris tells the world on its website they should consider?","I don't know how to answer that question. I mean -- But I think I have already answered it the best way I can, Mr. Schultz."
Okay.,"These are our positions, these are the positions of the public health, we agree on a lot of the fundamental positions. Do we disagree on some of the science? Yes. Do we disagree on some of their policies? Yes, we don't believe that there should be a prohibition on smoking. We think it is an adult practice, an adult should be allowed to make a decision whether they want to smoke or not, okay, and so we disagree on some fundamental levels, don't get me wrong. Do we disagree on some of the science? Yes."
Is it your understanding the Surgeon General seeks to prohibit smoking?,"Yes. I think they made that pretty clear in this report. I mean they call it -- it is the last kind of conclusionary chapter, if you will, the end game strategies, something like that the Surgeon General espoused."
"Well, I mean Philip Morris, I trust, despite self interest, would agree objectively, from a public health standpoint, if people didn't smoke traditional combustion cigarettes, this nation would be much better off from a public health standpoint, would it not?","I t h i n k we a g r e e t h a t c i g a r e t t e smoking causes diseases, there is no question about that, okay, we agree. We do believe people are aware of the fact that smoking is not a healthy habit. Okay. So now, then it comes down to choice, does it not, of an individual, whether they want to smoke or not or want to try to quit or quit. All right. We think adults should have that choice. I want that choice. I am a smoker, I want that choice. I don't want to be dictated to as an individual, I don't want a prohibition on something I enjoy. All right. We don't believe that that's the right approach, so we disagree with that as a fundamental strategy. Okay."
"Take a look, if you would, at the page 14 148, it is the next page in the excerpt from the report.",Exhibit 8?
"Yes, sir. If you look over on the last paragraph, you will see, it is above that diagram, the last paragraph, third sentence, states however -- well, I should read the preceding sentence. Nicotine is addictive, but is not a direct chemical carcinogen. Now, that's a true and accurate statement, correct, that Philip Morris would agree with?",Can you give me a second?
Absolutely.,"It is a big report. Let me get some context for a second. Okay. Please, if you wouldn't mind asking your question again."
"Sure. Let me go back and read that. Nicotine is addictive, but it is not a direct chemical carcinogen. That is a true and accurate statement with which Philip Morris agrees; correct?","Yes, we don't believe, neither does IARC, that nicotine is a carcinogen."
"However, by creating and sustaining addiction, it, nicotine, leads to the prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke that increases cancer risk for smokers. That is a true and accurate statement with which Philip Morris agrees; correct?","Not necessarily. I mean maybe for some people, that may be true, but it assumes things that are not shown. Okay. And this is good example where we may disagree with the science and the conclusions of the science. Everybody who -- So it has got to kind of follow some logic here, doesn't it? So everybody who smokes is addicted, gets cancer? No. Do they have higher risk? Absolutely. Everybody who is not addicted, can they get cancer? Yes, or disease. So you got to have both conditions met, so you can be an addicted smoker or a nonaddicted smoker and you can either get disease or not get disease, so if you caveated some of these things a little bit clearer in the science, then we may agree with the sentence, but it has got to be caveated a little bit."
"Okay. So now that I understand Philip Morris's position on this particular question, let me ask you this. Take a thousand smokers, a thousand of them are heavily addicted to nicotine, a thousand of them are not addicted in any way, do you believe there is going to be the same disease rates in the addicted and non-addicted smokers, is it that random, is that what you are telling me?","Yes, I mean please don't interpret what I said as random."
"Well, strike the random and just answer the first part. What do you predict the disease rates would be between those two --","And now you are getting outside of who I am and what my expertise is. I have no way of predicting that, okay, in this hypothetical, I have no way. Okay. The fact is that we know that you don't have to have all of these criteria met to get disease, whether you are addicted or not addicted. Okay."
"Sure. So let me go at it a different way. I don't quibble with that, but I am trying to get to what it means, just as we did in the role of nicotine.",Okay.
"In your opinion, if cigarette smoking were not addictive, would there have been fewer deaths related to smoking during the 20th Century?","A hypothetical, I have no idea how to answer that question. I mean cigarettes are addictive, right, it is part of what is a cigarette, they have always been addictive, even though the definition changed and they weren't, they have always been addictive, at least by today's standard, right. So -- and that's inherent to a cigarette. Okay. And we don't design it in, it is what a cigarette is inherently, they propose risks and they're addictive, okay, so I have no way of answering that question."
"Okay. You design cigarettes for a living. If it were up to you, if you could press a button, you b b ; /H;-J?VV know, add an ingredient, wave a magic wand, whatever you want to do to make your cigarettes, Philip Morris's cigarettes not addictive, would you prefer to produce a nonaddictive product?","I mean it is a speculative and a hypothetical. I could argue that what we did with denic was maybe a cigarette, maybe, big maybe, big caveat, a cigarette that wasn't addictive because it had so little levels of nicotine. I don't know, I don't know. So you have got a hypothetical, I have kind of got a real case that maybe it was less addictive, I don't know, so we have tried certain things, to be very clear."
"But my question is not about what you tried. My question is about your preference as someone who designs cigarettes for a living for Philip Morris, your preference, if you have your whim, hypothetically speaking, would you produce nonaddictive cigarettes or addictive cigarettes, all other things being equal?",You know --
"Right. All other things being equal, the only difference between that one is addictive and one is not addictive, you have no preference as to which sort of cigarette you would produce?",But it was a hypothetical.
Sure. It is a hypothetical.,"It is a hypothetical, so I have -- I would say either cigarette, as long as the product is enjoyable for a smoker and they knew the facts of it, you know, FDA was the referee and conveyed that in this hypothetical, and I am going to build on it a little bit, if you were Joe Consumer and the FDA said hey, this cigarette is not addictive, this tastes just the same but is addictive, here is all the message points, you choose, then it becomes a choice again for people. All right. That's why it is so important to have this standard we were talking about earlier, that's why it is so important that the FDA is the referee in how these things get communicated, it is not up to me any -31-.- b 0 / t-i i~i fe b b more."
"Right. And you understand, even today, the vast majority of the cigarettes that you design and Philip Morris sells are taken up initially, that initial choice that you are talking about, is made by children, adolescents; correct?","I have certainly seen what the Surgeon General and others have said, that lower than legal age are smoking cigarettes. We don't want that to happen, you know that, we don't want kids to smoke, I don't want kids to smoke. Okay. I mean the good news is it is at the lowest level it has been in 22 years. Okay. And I feel good that some of our programs have contributed to that. But we know there is an awful lot to do. We don't want kids to smoke, this is an adult product, this is an adult choice."
"But this goes back -- And I understand all of that, and this goes back to my hypothetical, given that the majority of people who are smoking your cigarettes for the first time are children, you have no preference as to whether, if you had the power, they would smoke an addictive product versus a nonaddictive product?",This is a hypothetical and --
It is.,"Because I would not want anything to be said to those kids to think for one second that this cigarette that is not addictive is any less dangerous than a normal cigarette, I think that would be wrong. That's why I can't answer that question. We shouldn't be communicating to kids."
I am not talking about communicating --,I think the message --
"I am asking you what product would you prefer they put in their mouths, because they're going to do it, they're doing it right now, if you had your whim as a cigarette designer, would it be an addictive cigarette they put in their mouths or a nonaddictive one?","And it is a passionate topic for me. The answer to your question is really simple, I don't want them smoking either one of those cigarettes. Okay."
"So when the Surgeon General says by creating and sustaining addiction -- Let me break down that sentence we started with. That nicotine creates and sustains addiction, does Philip Morris agree with that much of that statement?","For some people, that's true."
"And for those people, it leads to the prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke that increases cancer risk; correct?","And, again, for some people it is harder to quit, probably means they're smoking longer than they choose to smoke."
"Right. And it is a dose response relationship, the longer you smoke, the more of the dose you get; correct?","And as I said, for some people that is smoking is a lot harder to quit than others."
Let me ask it this way.,
"I mean you testify about Philip Morris's position on smoking and health including addiction, we have looked at some of your testimony. Is there any relationship in Philip Morris's estimation between the addictiveness of its cigarettes and the disease that its cigarettes cause?",I can tell you what I think. I don't know what Philip Morris --
"I want to know -- if you know -- if you don't know what Philip Morris's position is, let's start there and then I will ask you what you think.","Okay. I don't know of a policy we have on that topic Q A Q Okay. We as in Philip Morris. Right. When I review your trial testimony, I would say 80 percent of the questions begin with what Philip Morris does, Philip Morris believes, Philip Morris historically has done and believe. Right? I mean you testify on what Philip Morris does, believes, doesn't believe, wants, et cetera, when you come to trials; right?"
"Right. I am looking, for example, on the exhibit we just marked, why does Philip Morris believe this is important, why does Philip Morris change its position, does Philip Morris today support a consistent message, question after question on Philip Morris's position on smoking and health and addiction, you testify to those issues when you come to trials; right?","To some degree, I do, yes."
"And you would anticipate doing that in this trial, right, or is it somehow different?",No. I would anticipate and consistent with what we have discussed as paragraph 2 on my disclosure.
"Okay. And so the reason I did that, obviously, is that --",Okay. The paragraph.
"And the reason I mention that is because I am going to ask you questions about Philip Morris's position, and if you don't know, you don't know and then you can give me your opinion, and I think that's what we just did, but to put a bow on it, does Philip Morris, to your understanding, have any position today on any relationship between the addictiveness of its Vshi.3 / H ^ v i V ? products and the disease that its products cause?",I don't know of our position or a position on that.
"And if it had a position, do you believe you would probably be apprised of it?",I would think so.
"In other words, it is highly unlikely it has a position that you are just not aware of; right?","Maybe, yes, I would make that assumption. I don't know of any position, I try to make myself aware of our positions, but I don't know of any position we have on that specific topic."
From a public --,"Our position on smoking and addiction, I think is clearly stated on our website, and that's what I would consider our position to be, smoking is addictive."
"Let's take a look and see if we can figure out what that means a little bit more, smoking is addictive, and these will be questions along the same lines where I am inquiring into Philip Morris's position and, obviously, any insights or opinions you have as a scientist. NOTE: A document entitled A Report of the Surgeon General, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease ... what it means to you was marked as Jupe Exhibit No. 9.",
"I am marking as number 9 a report of the Surgeon General, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, and this is a pamphlet that accompanied the 2010 Surgeon General's report that was issued by the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services. Let me ask you, first of all, do you know if you have ever seen this before?","Yes. This is kind of the lay person pamphlet. Q A Q Correct. It paraphrases the report. Right. And on page 4, which I have included from this Surgeon General's publication, it says nicotine is a highly addictive drug. That is a factually accurate statement, is it not?"
"But it is your area on what the public messaging is from Philip Morris, and you have testified that you want absolutely the messages to be consistent that the public receives, correct, between -- from the public health authorities; correct?",Yes. I mean these are the messages that the public get and should get.
"Okay. So when I ask you whether nicotine is a highly addictive drug, and from Philip Morris's perspective, I guess it is at least true that, whether Philip Morris agrees or disagrees with that, it agrees that is the message the public should receive?","We agree the messages of the public health should be given to consumers. We are not going to quibble with these as messages. As I just did, we may debate what does it mean by highly addictive, that's somewhat arbitrary. Drug, okay, it meets certain definitions of a drug. Okay. But we are not going to get in the way of that message, we are not going to contest that message, we are not going to say to the public oh, look, look at this definition, that's not who or what we are about. This is the message the public gets is from the public health community. That's why I say when we disagree on science sometimes. You know, highly is such a simple word, but what does it mean."
"Well, you described it as arbitrary, and I am curious what the basis is to describe that as arbitrary. Certainly, you are aware of a great deal of science behind how addictive, how powerfully addictive nicotine is in relation to other drugs of abuse; correct?","Again, you are getting outside of my realm of expertise here."
You called it arbitrary. I am just trying to figure out why.,"Maybe I threw arbitrary out there as a way of saying what does that mean, highly addictive compared to what, okay. It is an arbitrary scale is the way I am using arbitrary, not arbitrary as a choice of words."
Right.,"It is a low, medium, high."
"Compared to cocaine, heroin, alcohol, other drugs of abuse, almost all -- every one of which has rates of addiction that are a fraction of nicotine, that would be one basis the Surgeon General reports for that, for example.",
Do you consider that arbitrary?,"Again, you are outside of my area. I can give you my opinion on it."
I --,Do you want to see my opinion on this?
I do.,"Okay. Nicotine, nicotine, I can go and buy gum and patches, right, if I want nicotine replacement therapy. If you look at the science on the addiction potential of nicotine, it is low, it is very, very low, it really is. So I am a scientist, I am a nerd when it comes to the specific nature of questions. This is why this is a brochure for the lay person. Right."
Right. It would be more accurate to say nicotine as delivered in the smoke of Philip Morris cigarettes is a highly addictive drug than to simply say nicotine; correct?,
Isn't that precisely your point?,"I wouldn't say Philip Morris cigarettes, I would say cigarettes."
Sure.,Because cigarettes are cigarettes when it comes to addiction.
The route of administration is important when you talk about drugs of abuse; right?,"So, again, you are asking me to expand. That's all I am saying here is you asked me on the arbitrary nature of highly. When it comes to science like this, this is really not hard science when you think about it, it is not designed to be hard science in my opinion, it is designed to be for the lay person, the nonscientist as opposed to reading the thousand page Surgeon General's report."
"Right. And that is -- When we talk about public messaging, that is really the most important message, isn't it, the one that lay people in the public would understand; right?",As far as what they listen to for matters --
"Well, as a general proposition.","Yes, I mean I think that's true on anything to do with an individual's health."
"Right. As we learned in trials, it doesn't do a lot of good to talk to lay people if they're lost in the clouds over in esoteric scientific issues; right? It should be simple, clear consistent message from public health authorities; right?",I think so.
Right. And Philip Morris thinks so?,
You testified to that?,"I think so, yes."
"In this message to the lay public designed by the Surgeon General to be communicated to the lay public, addiction keeps people smoking even when they want to quit. That is a characteristic or a hallmark of addiction, is it not?","I think it may be. Again, you are asking me levels of addiction, the characteristics of addiction. Just so we are clear, I am not going to offer opinions on addiction or anything associated with addiction. Okay. I certainly understand our position, I certainly wouldn't hold myself out as an expert, the expert in addiction and is it highly addictive, how it maintains, what is the mechanism by which it -- I am out of my league at that point."
"Just like I did on the last one, I assume, based on your testimony in Hallgren and other cases, at the very least, Philip Morris's position would be when the Surgeon General says addiction keeps people smoking even when they want to quit, Philip Morris's position would be even if we disagree with that, we do agree that is the message the public should receive; correct?",We agree that the public should get their messages from the public health on smoking and health.
And this is such a message?,Yes.
"Okay. And that is within the ambit of your testimony, it is something you have specifically testified about before; right?","I mean it is pretty clear, and that's why we link on our website to the Surgeon General --"
"A couple of things. Number one, I want to go back to the website that you have testified on before in the past, and that's number 6, and under addiction, it says Philip Morris USA agrees with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoking is addictive. It can be very difficult to quit smoking, but this should not deter smokers who want to try to quit from doing so, and then it has a link where you can click to learn more. When Philip Morris says on its website it can be very difficult to quit smoking, is there a distinction, if you know, that Philip Morris draws between the difficulty for an addicted smoker quitting versus a nonaddicted smoker?",No.
Do you know if it is Philip Morris's position that it is just as easy for an addicted smoker to quit as a nonaddicted smoker?,I don't think we have a position on that.
"And if cigarettes were not addictive, it would not be very difficult to quit smoking, right, I mean that's what addiction is; right?","By definition, you are exactly right. If something wasn't addictive, it wouldn't be hard to quit."
"And hard to quit, in the real world, means trying to quit and failing?",
"Let me strike that, because there are people who I am sure have quit in one try. I was not among them.",Okay.
You told me you smoked. Do you currently smoke?,I do.
Have you tried to quit smoking?,No.
Never t r i e d once?,Never tried.
Have you ever woke up promising yourself you were going to?,No.
How much do you smoke?,"It depends. Some days, I don't smoke, I go weeks without smoking. I don't smoke on vacation. I am kind of one of those unusual -- Some days, I smoke 40 cigarettes so --"
"I can see why you haven't tried to quit. If I could smoke like that, I probably wouldn't have tried to quit either, but I couldn't smoke like that, so I had to quit. So let me rephrase my question this way. Part of the -- when Philip Morris says it is very difficult to quit smoking, what that means, as a practical matter, for many smokers, is that it will take repeated quit attempts before they're able to permanently quit smoking; correct?",I can only assume that from what I have read on addiction.
"Right. And your life experience, I am sure.","Well, excuse me, but whether it is don't just try to do it by yourself, get support, some people need -- I mean this is -- all of these links take you to the system and these other support sites that are run by experts in the area, you know, get support, get a program, medication, you know, it depends on the individual, at least that's my interpretation of what this is. In some cases, if you fail, don't give up type of thing."
"Right. And all of that is linked under this addiction banner on the website, correct, because all of those pertain to the addictiveness of the product, the difficulty in refraining smoking, the need to have support to quit smoking, et cetera, all of those are features of the addictiveness of cigarettes; right?","I think they are features of how to quit smoking, that's the way I would characterize it, associated with addiction of cigarettes, to cigarettes."
"Right, but the only reason they are -- you have a concern about how to quit smoking and links to ways to help you quit smoking is because smoking is an addictive undertaking or an addictive product; right?","I agree, smoking is addictive."
"Well, my question is that's why you have to have these links and support networks and repeat quit attempts and such, all of those are features or byproducts of the fact that it is an addictive product; right?",
And that's why they're under addiction on PM's website?,That's my assumption.
"And if nicotine interferes with the ability of someone to quit smoking, whether it be on a short-term basis or a long-term basis, that will, by definition, result in prolonged exposure to the toxicants in cigarettes; correct?","If somebody can't quit or is having a hard time quitting and they're smoking more than they want to smoke, then it is going to prolong their smoking, I agree with that, and that's my -- you know, addiction is hard but don't give up."
Right. And --,Excuse me. Quitting is hard. Sorry. I misphrased. Quitting is hard but don't give up.
"Right. And when you -- Sure. You answered the question. Does PM, and I think you have answered this already, but I want to be sure, have its own definition of addiction separate and apart from the Surgeon General or any other health authority?","No, we don't own our own definition."
"You used the word choice several times in talking about smoking and addiction throughout our questioning. When you use that term choice in relation to smoking, are you talking about choices made by adults, adult smokers, a smoker continues smoking?","That's -- I mean yes, I mean I think of adult smokers. Okay, I think there is only one choice for nonadult smokers and that is don't smoke, they shouldn't have the choice, they should not be allowed to smoke. So when I talk about choice, I am talking about adults of legal age, whatever way you want to define it."
"And one of the reasons, among many, that children, adolescents should not be permitted to smoke is that they are not mature enough to make an informed decision on whether to undertake such a risky activity, is that a fair way to put it?",If you are asking me my opinion in my own life experience of having children --
"And then I will ask you Philip Morris's as well, yes.","Okay. Then I don't think they can make adult decisions, many adult decisions."
Right.,God knows the decisions I could have made when I was a kid type of thing.
"Right. 11 A But, you know, certainly the law is or -- 18 is legal age, and we agree with that, and it is an adult age.",
"And is Philip Morris's rationale in the support that it gives to prevent youth initiation in smoking that you described earlier, is that all based solely on the fact that that's the law or is there -- does Philip Morris share the same rationale that you and I just talked about?","It is a good question, I don't think I have really had a conversation with what is our rationale built on. I have assumed that, one, it is legal age, it is an age of adulthood, 18 is for this country, and you can make decisions as an adult, you make many decisions as an adult, so that's my assumption, but I have not had a conversation of are these the principles by which we have the support or is it just because that's the legal age."
"And back to my original point, when you use the word choice, when you are talking about smoking, you draw a distinction then, I take it, between the choice an adolescent might make to smoke or not to smoke and the choice an adult might make to smoke or not to smoke, and you are talking about adult choices; correct?","That's how I think about it, yes."
"Everything I have just said is correct, it was a compound question, but it was all correct; right?","When I think of choice, when I use choice, I am talking about adults, as I said. Under the age of adulthood, I don't think you have a choice, you should not smoke. Does that make sense?"
"Yes. Does Philip Morris -- but children do smoke, and as we have already talked about, the vast majority of people who take up smoking are children.",
And I guess what I am driving at is do you see the choice that they're making is the same as these adult choices that you are talking about when you give testimony?,I think of it as adult choice.
"Okay. I think that gets me where -- the understanding that I was after. FDA regulation. I understand, in talking with Mr. Sexton, that your disclosure, to the extent it talks about regulations back into the 1960s, is going to pertain to warnings on the packs, advertisements --",
--it sounded like maybe TV and radio advertising --,
"-- going away. Are there any other regulations that you intend to testify about at trial other than the, obviously, current FDA regulation?",May I look at something really quickly --
Sure.,-- just to refresh.
"Okay. And what is the basis for your understanding of the regulations, be they the warnings, the ban on advertising or what have you, before you joined the company in 1995, any regulations that predate that, what is the basis for your understanding of those regulations?","Okay. So '95, '89, obviously, I have been working in tobacco since '89. Okay. Essentially, many of these documents predate my arrival, if you will, so, obviously, we keep archives, there is archives of the Surgeon General and information out there, so it has been a compilation of understanding our rules, understanding our requirements over time, it is just part of my job. I mean part of my job is I set all the specifications for our packaging and assure compliance with other groups that our packaging is compliant with the regulations, so it is just one of those things that you have learned over time. Does that make sense?"
"Sure. But you wouldn't have a need, for example, to ensure compliance with the '67 warning or '66 warning?",No.
"So I am trying to figure out the basis -- did you just go back and do a document review on that, or how did you learn what it is you intend to testify about on that subject?","It is really a combination of document review, kind of knowing about these things, just learning about them and just build your foundation on what is current versus what is past, so it is a combination of approaches, predominantly document review."
"Have you reviewed documents, be they FTC reports, FDA has commented on it, CDC has commented on it, pertaining to the effectiveness of the warnings on cigarette packs at any point in time?","No, I wouldn't call myself a communications expert on the effectiveness of warnings. Does that make sense? I mean my job is to put the warnings on there, make sure we are compliant with the rotational aspects and the size of the font and everything else we have to worry about as far as what our packaging requirements are. I don't study the effectiveness of warnings."
"Did you follow, whether it was back in the '90s with the original push by FDA under David Kessler, or under the recent regulations, the push for graphic warnings?","More recently, certainly with the current FDA oversight, because that is part of what I need to do. If we -- when those rules become law, then we got to change our packs obviously. So I have kept abreast of the situation, if you will."
Have you in that capacity or any other more recently encountered literature addressing or public statements addressing the effectiveness of the '85 and pre-'85 warnings?,"Nothing that comes to mind, no."
"Do you understand the FDA's rationale behind the push for graphic warnings is that the old warnings are ineffective, or at least not as effective as graphic warnings would be?","I think in the statute, the FDA is asked to look at graphic warnings to be more effective, state of the art. A lot of countries around the world carry them. So take a look at the warnings. I mean I know this has been done periodically, it certainly has been executed periodically in other considerations through time, so it is another way of looking at are the warnings effective as they possibly can be to inform about the risks of smoking cigarettes."
"I assume, if you know, that Philip Morris's position would be that the warnings should be as effective as the public health authorities believe they ought to be, correct, consistent with the position we have already talked about?","What I can say is Philip Morris supported FDA, Philip Morris supported standards, which I kind of lump the warnings and communications against, based on science, a strong science foundation, so if the science says that warning A is more effective than warning B and it is the law, then we will be compliant with that."
"And when you said supported FDA, and it is my understanding that Philip Morris didn't join the lawsuit to stop the graphic warnings; right?","Not to my knowledge, no."
And so Philip Morris -- I am trying to look for the right verb -- I don't know if it would be acquiesces or agrees with the science behind the FDA's -- let me ask it this way. Does Philip Morris disagree with FDA's rationale for its seeking to implement graphic warnings?,"We have made our comments known to FDA, they asked us for comments on warnings and this topic, and they're public information, and, you know, it is rather lengthy comments that we have provided back to FDA. I don't pretend to be able to sit here and retell you exactly what is in that document, but it certainly talked about coverage of the warnings, and I may be wrong on this, but what I call kind of First Amendment rights. Okay. That's what our comments are based on to FDA."
And those are part of the public comment process?,"I believe they're public, yes. I believe they're probably on our website, if they're public."
"Do you know, and I will move on, offhand, whether there is any discussion of the effectiveness of existing warnings in PM's comments to FDA?",Yes.
"Has Philip Morris, and when I say Philip Morris, obviously, you are designing around Philip Morris cigarettes, so I am sticking with Philip Morris as the party in the case rather than talking about -- I understand the work is done at Altria Client Services.",Okay.
But I am going to lump them together for purposes of my questions. Has Philip Morris changed the specifications for its Marlboro brand cigarettes in order to comply with any FDA regulatory requirements since the implementation of the 200 9 Act?,"I can answer that in two ways, just so I am really crisp and clear. We have not had to change anything about the cigarette, the stick, if you will, just being really clear here, in order to be in compliance. Does that make sense? We have, obviously, had to change our packaging to be in compliance with the statute, and that is the removal of descriptors."
Were you involved in that as part of your oversight of packaging?,"At that time, I was not, I didn't have the packaging group."
"Who was in charge of that then, do you know?","Oh, who was that. That would have been the gentleman I talked about earlier, Mark Cruise, the engineer guy."
And have not changed the sticks because they're grandfathered in?,"Well, you asked me a question of to be compliant; right?"
Right.,And the answer to that question is no. All right. So grandfather has got nothing to do with that. Does that make sense?
"Yes. The way the Act works, there are cigarettes that as of a given date --","Right. February 15, 2007."
Right. I used the term grandfathered in.,That's right. That's right.
"Your Marlboro cigarettes, as of that date, were grandfathered in; correct?","That design, yes, that's correct."
"And so I guess my question -- Let me ask it a different way, because it didn't really take account of that. Has the Marlboros that are rolling out of Philip Morris's factories today, have they been changed design wise in a way that they would not have been changed absent implementation of the 200 9 Act? That's a very lawyerly way to ask whether the Act has required or caused them to be changed in some way?","All right. Let's see if I can answer this the best I can. The Act has not required us to change anything about the way we design, develop or manufacture our cigarettes absent the descriptors on the pack."
Have you voluntarily changed anything about the sticks that you would not have changed but for the existence of the Act?,"Since March, I forget the date, 2011, we cannot change anything about our cigarettes without first authorization from FDA."
All right. Are there changes that you would like to have made to your cigarettes that you have been unable to make because of that approval process?,"Yes, and we have made applications to FDA in order to get permission for those changes."
What are those called?,Substantial Equivalence applications.
And there is a big backlog of those; right?,"There is a lot of them, yes."
Has Philip Morris had any approved?,"No, we have not."
"Okay. Have any of the changes that Philip Morris seeks to implement but has been unable to implement design wise due to the backlog of Substantial Equivalence applications been a design change that, in its estimation, would result in a safer cigarette in terms of human health, I am talking?","No, because these Substantial Equivalence applications, that they may be modification to a cigarette but they don't change -- forgive me, because I will butcher the rules and the statute, but those changes really shouldn't change anything about that cigarette and its performance."
Right.,"So those -- those Substantial Equivalence applications are okay, I may use paper from vendor A and I want to use paper from vendor B, I first have to get market authorization. The cigarette performs identical but the vendors are different, I need permission to do that. That's what the substantial equivalence pathway permits you to do."
"Then there is -- I used to know this at one time, so maybe between us we can screw it up, there is a process for applying for essentially a reduced harm product, is there not?",Yes.
Do you know the name of that process or the product?,"It is a 911 pathway, modified risk tobacco product."
"Okay . Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information Redacted A Q A Trade Secret Information Redacted Okay. And just so we are clear, that guidance was not available in 200 9, that regulation, it wasn't until a couple of years later, 2011 or '12 before that MRTP guidance was available. Q Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information I mean, obviously, it is not proprietary if I have heard about it. Maybe it is RJR, I don't know.",It is not Philip Morris.
Okay.,"I would be curious as to what that product is, because I am not sure we are on the same page actually. I am not sure I should have said that, This is why we preserve our proprietary Q frankly. A information."
I could be dreaming. Let me ask you about E-cigarettes. Have you smoked E-cigarettes yourself?,"Yes, I have."
And do you know if Philip Morris takes any position on the risk profile for addiction or addictive propensity of E-cigarettes versus combustion cigarettes?,We put on our -- and I got to be very clear here. You asked me the question does Philip Morris. Right?
Yes.,"Philip Morris does not make E-cigarettes, so if I answered that incorrectly, I apologize. We have another company, NuMark, N-U-M-A-R-K, who is the producer and marketer and manufacturer, et cetera, of E-cigarettes, so Philip Morris doesn't do anything with E-cigarettes. Okay."
"Is it an Altria company, NuMark?","Yes. Good point, it is an Altria company. We do sell E-cigarettes or E-vapor products, and we do have a warning label that says nicotine is addictive, something along those lines. Certainly, that is the essence of the warning label as well as other warnings."
Do you know whether that's required or voluntary?,"No, it is not required because E-cigarettes, until recently, are not -- did not fall under the FDA. They have just deemed --"
Right.,"-- that they're going to fold them in, but it is not required, it is something we have done voluntarily, we as in NuMark."
Do you know if the nicotine from -- for NuMark E-cigarettes comes from tobacco?,It does.
"Does FDA regulate the amount of nicotine PM uses in its cigarettes, the ones that -- traditional cigarettes it is manufacturing today?","No, there is no regulation over what goes -- Let me rephrase that. They certainly have the authority to regulate levels of anything that goes into a cigarette, okay, but there is no regulation to your question on nicotine that is naturally occurring in tobacco."
"And it cannot compel the reduction of nicotine to zero, correct, under the Act?","Yes, the Congress said you cannot take it to zero."
Is there a threshold between something and zero that would not have the propensity or potential to addict human smokers?,"That's the question. That's the question that FDA is looking to answer through the establishment of that threshold standard, as we discussed earlier today."
So the standard you were referring to earlier is specifically a threshold for addictiveness standard?,"Yes, and that's what they have, through NIH, they have funded a lot of research for their TCOR centers, I don't know if you are familiar with them, to look at is there a way of establishing a threshold level by which cigarettes are no longer addictive or maybe as addictive and how do you measure that. That's the standard I am referring to."
"I asked you a moment ago if FDA regulated the amount of nicotine in PM cigarettes, and you said it did not. Has it announced any intention to do so in the near future?",
"But just to bring you back to where we were, has FDA announced any intention to regulate the amount of nicotine PM uses in its cigarettes?","I have not heard of any intentions, but they certainly have the regulatory authority to regulate performance standards."
Marlboros produced today contain an addictive dose of nicotine; correct?,"Marlboros contain tobacco and tobacco is in nicotine. As I have said many times today, cigarettes are addictive, whether it is a Marlboro or not a Marlboro, okay, they all contain tobacco, they all burn tobacco, they all have the potential to be addictive."
"In other words, Philip Morris has not manufactured, in response to FDA, in response to the Act or for any other reason or purpose, a Marlboro that it deems to be below the threshold for addictiveness; c o r r e c t ?","It goes back to what we discussed earlier, Mr. Schultz, what is that threshold."
"Right. I don't make cigarettes, I don't know. The answer is it hasn't done it; right?","Hang on. The answer to the question is what is that threshold, okay, and how do you measure that that cigarette is no longer addictive, so until you answer that question, you can't design cigarettes. And then you are going to ask me the question how do you get the addictiveness out. That's a whole new question of science."
"Regardless of whether you know where the threshold is, and you recognize Philip Morris has studied threshold for addictiveness in nicotine for decades, before you even became involved with the company, correct, you have seen documents to that effect?","No, I wouldn't say I have."
You have never seen a document in which Philip Morris is studying the threshold level for addictiveness of nicotine in cigarettes?,No.
"Okay. R e g a r d l e s s o f w h e t h e r you know t h e threshold that is the cut-off point below which a cigarette becomes nonaddictive, we do know that all of the cigarettes Philip Morris sells today are above that threshold, i.e., they are addictive; correct?","No, you can't say that. There is no threshold. What threshold are you talking about?"
"Wherever the threshold lies, it is Philip Morris's position, is it not, that its cigarettes, the smoking of its cigarettes are addictive; right?","Maybe I misunderstood you. Cigarettes are addictive, I agree with that."
So they're above the threshold for nonaddictive.,"Okay. They're above a threshold. The question is does the threshold even exist. If -- The cigarette with no nicotine in it, is it addictive? I don't know. Nobody knows the answer to that question. So if the threshold is negative, I don't know what that means, but if it is zero and it is still addictive, then there is no threshold. That's why I am contesting your point."
"I understand, and whether it is the absence of a threshold or the inability to know where the threshold lies, we know that every cigarette, and this is the real point, that Philip Morris produces today is addictive; correct?","I would say every cigarette produced around the world is addictive, it is not just Philip Morris products."
And I don't mean to imply that.,Okay.
"But you work for Philip Morris, Altria, and you are testifying for Philip Morris in a case about Philip Morris cigarettes, that's why I asked about Philip Morris; and it is true about Philip Morris cigarettes; correct?","Philip Morris cigarettes, as our website said, cigarettes are addictive, yes."
Do you know how many cigarettes Philip Morris sold in the USA last year?,"Round figures from reports, yes."
Over a hundred billion?,Yes.
Do you know the number -- What number would you give as a round figure?,"I think it was maybe 125 billion, round figures."
"What changes -- I assume this is under your auspice, or you may otherwise have knowledge, given your intended testimony, what changes has Philip Morris made to the way it tests its cigarettes in response to the 200 9 Act or FDA regulation pursuant to that Act?","Yes. The -- Two ways. One is the FDA has implemented, I forget the statute number or the section number, but we call it HPHC testing, harmful and potentially harmful constituent testing, and we have tested all of our packings for, I believe it was about 25 constituents found in smoke and/or tobacco, so that is a change to how we have done things."
Let me pause there. Had Philip Morris never tested those constituents before implementation of the FDA?,"Yes, we had. We had. But they specified how to test them, how to smoke them, in other words, using the ISO methodology and the Health Canada regimen, they may have been a little bit more prescriptive than that, but that was kind of the requirement, so we have tested for these constituents over our years but not to the specificity that the FDA r e q u i r e d ."
Okay. And t h e n t h e s e c o n d way?,"For our substantial equivalence pathways, we have to provide additional information that we don't necessarily generate on a daily basis."
"Is there anything that you had never generated before, testing wise, that you have to generate now in order to report on substantial equivalence?","No, nothing comes to mind."
Have there been FDA inspections of Philip Morris cigarette manufacturing facilities?,Yes.
Can you give me an idea of how many?,"Well, we have two facilities that are open for inspection, our manufacturing center, that was about a 7-day inspection for inspectors -- well, two inspectors, one from the Office of Science, I think one 17 from the Office of Compliance or their legal counsel, days, work days, a full expose into how we manufacture cigarettes going from direct materials, papers, et cetera, tobacco process and cigarette construction, 21 shipping of materials, traceability. During that days, I think they had 125 formal requests for information including specifications, blend recipes, flavors, et cetera. We took them to other parts of our facility, they requested open door access, obviously. They also came back at a later point, we have a different address, if you will, location for where we produce reconstituted tobacco, and they spent a couple of days going through, I think it was a couple of days, going through how we make our different types of reconstituted tobacco and the ingredients that we use in their production, the quality, et cetera."
"Let me make sure I understand. You have two -- when you said two facilities, is one the recon facility and one is the regular, or two cigarette facilities and one recon facility?","We have one recon facility, reconstituted tobacco facility, and one manufacturing facility. We only produce cigarettes, finished cigarettes in one facility."
And where is that?,Down the road here in Richmond.
When was it built?,"'72, I think. '72, '73."
What about the recon facility?,"Late '70s, '78 I think, '77, '78."
"Are there plans underway to -- an imminent change of manufacturing facilities for Philip Morris cigarettes, in other words, y'all are building a new facility right now somewhere?",No. No. We are shrinking.
So fair to say the facilities that manufacture all finished Philip Morris cigarettes today including the reconstituted tobacco that goes into them were purchased with profits that Philip Morris earned before 1999?,"Look, I mean if they were built before 1999, I am sure some transaction of cash occurred during that time frame, right. Purchased, finished purchase versus continued mortgage, I don't know. I don't know. Of course, we upgraded that facility to maintain, you know, its safety, it efficiency, et cetera, so, you know, it is an ongoing asset improvement, but I got to believe a lot of the money was spent on the '70s in order to build those facilities."
"Take me through, what are -- I mean I understand the general generic steps of manufacturing a cigarette, but in terms of Philip Morris facilities, getting, you know, tobacco from the field to the finished product, how many major physical plants or facilities does it go through that are under Philip Morris's control or ownership?","So let me -- I will give you ownership and control, kind of differentiation. The farmer grows the tobacco, we don't own or control that, all right. He comes to a receiving station, basically a place to drop off the tobacco, we don't own the receiving station. Our agents buy the tobacco based on visual and poundage. From there, it leaves -- we own the tobacco, we send it to a place that is called a stemmery, probably a misnomer, it is a de-stemmery. We don't own the stemmery."
Let me pause you there. Where is the stemmery?,We have got them in North Carolina. There are two different companies in North Carolina that do this for us.
All right.,"For the preponderant -- for the majority, excuse me, of our tobacco. There is some that is done offshore, which we buy offshore. I am just kind of giving you the domestic footprint."
Sure.,"So it is stemmed or, excuse me, de-stemmed, then it is shipped to our warehouses, so we own the tobacco and it is in our possession at that point, so we age it in our warehouses and then it comes into our manufacturing center."
"""Where are the warehouses located?",Around the Richmond area.
And they're owned by Philip Morris or a Philip Morris entity?,"I am going to say owned or rented, I am not exactly sure -- I think we owned them."
Do you know how long you have owned any or all of them?,No.
Do you know whether any of them or all of them have been purchased in the last 15 years versus last 30 or 40 years?,"I really don't know. I know there have been warehouses, the same warehouses, I have been here for 20 years almost, and it is the same warehouses. I just really don't know. So when we pull it from the warehouse, it goes to our manufacturing center, and so that chopped leaf is converted to cut tobacco, and then it is fed to where we assemble the cylinder of tobacco, wrap the paper around it and put the filter to it. That's all within one building. We pack it and then we ship it out and then it goes through the distribution chain, so it goes out to wholesalers and distribution centers. So we sell the cigarette, if you will, through the wholesale environment, so we don't sell it to 7-Elevens, we sell it to distributors."
And do you manufacture for PMI?,No.
"They have their own manufacturing facilities? A Q A Yes In Virginia or elsewhere? Philip Morris International, completely different company since 2007, has no cigarette production in the United States. To my knowledge, the only thing they do in the United States is buy some tobacco from the farmers.",
"Are you aware of -- well, I think it is in your disclosure, in fact. Describe for me, if you would, the ways in which Philip Morris has changed marketing or advertising as a result of the FDA Act, the 200 9 Act, or implementation under the FDA.","Under the FDA, ever since '98 we have had restrictions on our markets and our products. Okay. That fell under the umbrella of the Master Settlement Agreement, where part of that agreement was to stop the use of sponsorships of sporting or concerts, paraphernalia or on shirts, hats, baseball caps kind of thing, stadium signage, mass transit signage, restrictions on magazine advertising, so that went into effect in '98 time frame. A lot of that has been carried over into articles under the statute of the FDA."
Right.,"There is also point of sale retail environment requirements that are as far as signage and square footage of the sign and so forth and so on. These all fall through MSA and FDA. I think FDA essentially adopted those elements of MSA, and I am trying to think if there is anything that was materially different in what the FDA required of us other than, obviously, descriptors."
"I mean those things were in place, what you just described, putting aside descriptors, up until -- those were already in place under the MSA; right?",Yes.
So you did not have to change what you were doing post 2009 --,Sure.
-- because you were already complying with it?,Yes.
"Are there, and maybe you just answered with saying descriptors, any there any other changes that Philip Morris has had to make since 200 9 to advertising and marketing --",
-- due to the Act or FDA implementation?,"There are changes in our business practices as far as what we have to provide the FDA, okay, so there is an oversight of production, if you will --"
"Yes, I am about to talk about that.",--of marketing information --
Okay. Maybe I am not about to talk about that. Marketing information meaning?,"So twice a year, we have to disclose to FDA a listing of all the products that we sell, manufacture, and provide, and I will butcher the words again, but we have to provide marketing type information with that. Again, that's not something I have to do, I don't know the intimate details of it, but it is for oversight by FDA."
Do you know the name of that document or the title of it roughly that is submitted twice a year?,"I know it as product listing. It may have a fancy FDA name, but I just see it as product listing."
Does it include specs on the cigarettes like nicotine content and things of that nature?,"No. I mean I understand what you mean as far as the FTC used to have marketing expenditures and requirements as well as smoke analysis of our cigarettes. The only -- that falls under a different chapter of the statute, that comes under what we call the HPHC requirements, so it is not part of the product listing requirements."
Do you know who is in charge of preparing or submitting the product listing within the company?,That comes under Jim Dillard's operation.
"Let me mark, because I think this will help us walk through, and this will be the last exhibit, an FDA website page, it is called FDA Facts, under the Family Smoking Prevention Act.",
"And I am interested -- This is, of course, an overview of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and FDA regulation. If we look down on the lower right-hand column, on the first page, where it mentions the law prohibits reduced harm claims including light, low, mild, et cetera, that is what you are referring to as descriptors; correct?","Yes, that's what I mean."
"Did Philip Morris, do you know, agree with the need for or propriety of removing descriptors from cigarettes?",You kind of lost me on your question. Say it again.
Yes. Did Philip Morris take a position one way or the other on whether it was appropriate or necessary to take descriptors like light and low tar off of cigarettes?,"You know, if you look back, since I'd say 2000, 2001, the public health had really started to take a position -- change their position really on low tar cigarettes and was kind of coming together, and we looked to places like FTC for guidance on these types of things, because we were using lights, we were using lower tar, it had been permissive for many years on information where the public health was on low tar cigarettes, so prior to FDA, we had asked for guidance, we had taken off certain things in our products in early 2000, pre-FDA. On some of our cigarettes, it would say lowered tar and nicotine, we took that off. So we were looking for guidance on how to communicate these things. We certainly feel, and we made our comments available, again, I won't pretend to be able to retell you what they say in the comments to descriptors, but it certainly -- we were quite happy with the fact that somebody had made a rule, okay, because we had been accused of misleading on lights, and that's where the public health was on this position. So, again, oversight of our industry, control of our industry, you know, we fully expected the descriptors to come off as the bill was moving through C o n g r e s s ."
"I guess my question, more to the point is, do you know whether Philip Morris in those comments or elsewhere agreed with FDA, to paraphrase, that a light's descriptor was misleading?","I don't know if we agreed on its misleading. We wanted somebody to make the referee decision, I keep using that analogy, okay, but we really needed somebody to decide for us, a level playing field associated with this, so if Philip Morris took lights off of their cigarettes voluntarily and the other manufacturers did not, what kind of message does that send. So having the referee, the level playing field, the performance standard the FDA afforded, it made a lot of sense to us as a company."
Would that hold true for plain packaging as well?,"I think you have got different comments, I mean you can -- as I said, we discussed our comments already as far as graphic warnings labels and First Amendment rights. You are starting to get out of my league of comfort here, okay, of plain packaging, because there is First Amendment issues to my understanding. But, you know, again, performance standards, we asked for them, we supported them as long as they're based on science. Okay."
"Well, let me be clear. Under the Act, if FDA pushes for plain packaging, is it Philip Morris's position that it opposes it on First Amendment grounds or you don't know whether Philip Morris has a position one way or the other on plain packaging?",I don't know what our action will be. I don't know.
"Okay. If we look over at the second page of this last exhibit, we see that -- indication that the Act, I am under the first bullet point, requires the tobacco industry to disclose to the FDA its research on the health and dependency effects of tobacco use, as well as its marketing data upon request, and I think you have touched on some of that already.",I have.
"Where it states that you may be required to disclose research related to the dependency effects of your cigarettes, do you know whether there has been a compilation and report of information to FDA pursuant to the Act on the dependency effects of your cigarettes?","We have certainly provided FDA documentation that met the requirements of this specific request, whether it is health -- I think of it as health effects of smoking, so there was more detail that was provided to us, I wasn't party to putting those requests together, but I know we sent them a lengthy and thick, if you will, compilation of documents."
"They distinguish between health and dependency effects. I mean there are health effects, literature on health effects, literature on dependency effects, and it is your understanding Philip Morris has submitted to FDA a single compilation on one occasion of information that addresses health and dependency effects?","I don't want to commit to a single point in time of one compilation. I know we have provided information that met the requirements of this request. I am sorry, I don't know the details, how many times we have done this, was it one compilation, was it thousands of documents, I just don't have a good handle on that."
"Right. And the reason I ask is I understand you are going to testify about the authority of the FDA to do lots of things, and I am interested in how it has actually changed practices at Philip Morris, what has Philip Morris had to do versus what does the FDA have the authority to make Philip Morris do at some potential point in time. So who does know -- who is the best person to answer what was given, when it was given, how many times it was given, what it was comprised of, et cetera?","As far as what the information is, there may be some information on our website, some of it we just disclose publicly, because it is available, I say publicly, it is not protected in any way, confidential, et cetera. This also falls under the Jim Dillard heading, all right, as far as what information specifically we have given to the FDA, because he is our regulatory affairs individual, so everything funnels through him. I was just not party to this request, but I do know and my testifying is FDA can ask for documents on smoking and health, we give them what we have. A lot of it is already public literature, a lot of it may be on our public website, but some of it may be new information that we generate, and we have done that on occasion voluntarily as well as far as new documents around menthol."
Do you know whether Philip Morris has kept a record of what it has produced to FDA?,I am sure we have.
And do you know whether any documents were disclosed to FDA that have not been disclosed in litigation or otherwise publicly disclosed?,I don't know the answer to that question.
Do you know if there was a particular section in the submission to FDA that addressed dependency effects specifically?,"I am assuming there is, but I just don't know for a fact whether there is a section or documents that pertained to dependency."
"Do you know how Philip Morris went about collecting information, and by that -- strike that. Do you know whether Philip Morris has done or Altria Client Services, obviously, particular testing, study, experimentation or what have you on dependency effects of its cigarettes in order to comply with the Act?","No. I mean you don't have to do work in order to comply at this part of the chapter or statute. It is basically and, again, I will paraphrase loosely, what do you have that meets the criteria of this request, please turn it over. It isn't a request of oh, you don't have information on blue cigarettes or red cigarettes or green cigarettes, go generate data, that's not the type of request this is. It is basically documents you have in your possession, knowledge, daily business, that pertains to these topic areas."
Documents from the date of the Act or are they reaching back into the 1940s and '50s with their --,"Great question. I think it is a compilation of things. I mean as we generate new documents, they can come in and boom, you know, we got new documents type of thing."
"Let me ask it this way: Do you know whether Philip Morris has produced documents to FDA concerning dependency effects of its cigarettes that -- which were manufactured, either the documents or the cigarettes, before 1999?","I am sorry, I just don't know the details of the documents that were turned over."
You would expect Jim Dillard to know that?,"I would ask. You asked me who I would consult with, and that's who I would consult with."
"Would you then agree Jim Dillard sounds like probably the person, at least based on your knowledge, who is most qualified within Altria Client Services to address what Philip Morris has had to do around the issue of producing information on the health and dependency effects of its cigarettes to FDA?","I would consult with Jim Dillard. I mean his group is our regulatory affairs and regulatory reporting. As I said, everything that goes to the FDA of a scientific nature goes through Jim's group."
Do you know whether Philip Morris is currently conducting any nicotine receptor research?,"Not to my knowledge, no."
Or having any conducted on its behalf by someone else?,Not that I am aware of.
"That sounds like the sort of thing, if it were occurring, it would have to be reported under dependency effects, right, or do you know?","Yes, that's exactly right. If you are doing work and they come back and say give us an update on dependency, it is my understanding that anything you are doing in that area becomes part of that request."
"And given the phrasing of that, I take it, it is only upon request, you don't have, Philip Morris, a duty to send a monthly report to FDA on this stuff; r i g h t ?","You know, a g a i n , I am s o r r y , I j u s t d o n ' t know the logistical details of this chapter. Okay. I mean how often, do they write us letters on a periodic basis, do we volunteer information, I just don't recall. I never paid attention to the logistical details."
"Do you know if Philip Morris or Altria Client Services, I am lumping them together, obviously, or anyone on its behalf is currently working on studying nicotine metabolism in humans?",I don't know.
What about biomarkers of exposure?,"Well, yes, I mean we just published -- well, we publish on occasion on biomarkers of exposure. We just published in the last six months."
On nicotine specifically? I saw the one on menthol.,"Yes, this -- the one I am thinking about at least that comes to mind was nicotine was one of the biomarkers. This is the one with high nicotine, low nicotine."
"How about human behavioral responses to nicotine, is there any current research at Philip Morris or on its behalf, to your understanding or knowledge, on human behavioral responses to nicotine?","You know, I just don't know. I don't keep abreast of everything that goes on, unfortunately."
None that you know of?,None that I know of.
How about animal studies on nicotine?,"There may be. We do animal studies on occasion, as needed. We try not to do them, but, if necessary, we do do them."
What would be the purpose for current work on studying nicotine on animals at Philip Morris or on its behalf?,"It could well be new products, and when you say nicotine, I am translating nicotine into products or materials, so if we are doing animal studies needed for new products, assessment of new products, MRTP type applications, but they may not be associated with 100 percent nicotine. Does that make sense?"
Nicotine-containing products?,Nicotine-containing products is a better way to describe it.
Whole smoke experiments?,It depends. It depends if it is oral or s m o k a b l e .
So y e s a s t o smokable p r o d u c t s ?,"Smokable , E - c i g a r e t t e s , o r a l t o b a c c o , i t could be a combination, whatever is necessary."
"Let me ask it this way: Are the animal studies that Philip Morris is undertaking that involve nicotine, are they studies on nicotine per se or are they studies more along the lines of generally reduced exposure products, if it is fair to characterize them either way?","I think it is better to characterize them as exposure products or reduced exposure products, pardon me, or changes to products. I don't think we study nicotine, all right, it is the cigarette or the cigarette smoke that we would be studying."
All right. How about human studies on the dependency effects of nicotine?,"No, I don't know of any studies we are independently doing."
"When you say independently, for each of these questions, I mean performed by Philip Morris, one of its Altria affiliates or by anyone on its behalf or under its control.",Good clarification. I don't know of any studies that we are doing.
"How about animal studies, the particular and specific focus of which is the dependency effects of nicotine?",Not that I am aware of.
"Okay. And I think you had answered that, but I wanted to put it into FDA language. Has PM at this point, and you may have answered this earlier, been required to disclose every ingredient in its cigarette brands at this point?",Yes.
To the FDA?,To the FDA.
"That includes all processing aids, all paper additives, all filter additives and everything that goes into any cigarette that Philip Morris manufactures?",Yes.
Someone at FDA has all of that information?,Yes.
That is not made public; correct?,Correct.
Is it by brand?,It is by packing.
"All right. Does Philip Morris keep a list of historical packings for -- by brand, for things like Marlboro, for example?",We may. I am assuming we do somewhere.
"I mean I am just wondering, if I came to Philip Morris and said I would like to know the different various packings for Marlboro, quote unquote, reds, over this 10-year period, does that information exist somewhere within the company?",I got to believe it does. I am 99 percent sure it does somewhere or it can be cobbled together.
Can two -- I would assume you will know this. Can two PM brands have the same nicotine content but different nicotine delivery?,Yes.
Do you know how many different forms of nicotine are used in PM cigarettes currently?,I don't understand your question.
"Well, the FDA -- I saw reference to reporting on the different forms of nicotine that are delivered in its products. I mean, obviously, nicotine takes various chemical forms; correct?",No.
There is only one nicotine?,"Well, nicotine into itself is a chemical, right, and that's one. Nicotine in tobacco, which is where it comes from, is usually in a combination of some type of carboxylic acid salt, so nicotine tartrate or nicotine malate, so it may be -- have a chemical structure, how it occurs naturally in the plant, so I am not sure what your question is."
Do you know of any reporting by Philip Morris to the FDA on the different forms of nicotine delivered in its products or contained in its products is probably a more appropriate term?,"I don't know. Well, I know of no listing because there is only one form of nicotine. I am really confused on this one. Nicotine is nicotine and it is what is naturally occurring in the tobacco. So if I pick up a tobacco plant and I say how much nicotine is in there, then I am going to measure one chemical, it is called nicotine, and it is going to tell me yes, that is how much is in that leaf. It is not going to be version A, version B, version C, it is just nicotine. That's what nature puts in the leaf. I am confused by your question, you can tell, huh?"
"Let me ask you, what would determine -- if you have two brands with the same nicotine content that can deliver different amounts, what determines the different deliveries?","The filter, the ventilation, the paper."
"Is that purely a matter of subtraction, by which I mean you take two cigarettes with the same nicotine content, they're both going to deliver the same amount of nicotine, assuming they're smoked the same way, except that, for example, with more ventilation, we deliver less, with, you know, a tighter filter or a different chemical component in the filler, we deliver less. You see what I am saying?",That's exactly right.
"How about the inverse of that, which is two that have the same nicotine content and because of a given design parameter, one of them delivers more than the other would?","As a cigarette designer, all I really know how to do is reduce the amount of nicotine coming out of the cigarette. I have no tool to elevate it, no mechanism to elevate it. In other words, a designer reduces the amount of nicotine coming out of the cigarette, not increasing it."
"But the amount of -- I mean if you put amount number one in a cigarette and you put amount number one times two in a cigarette and then reduce number two by 25 percent, you are going to have more nicotine delivered in the second cigarette; right?",Oh
You determine how much nicotine can go into that rod to begin with; right?,"Look, I mean we know -- it sounds -- I can see your confusion on highly engineered now. There is a weight of tobacco that goes in a cigarette and you can pretty much -- because -- tobacco is somewhat tobacco. That's the biggest indicator of how much nicotine is in a cigarette. So we don't manipulate the amount of nicotine per milligram of tobacco, we just don't do that. All right. In other words, what nature serves us up is what we use. We don't add and we don't subtract what nicotine is in that tobacco. We can reduce how much comes through in the smoke, through filters and ventilation and paper, but we don't change that ratio in the tobacco. Like I said, it is what nature serves up to us. Q_ Right. Do you use any genetically modified tobaccos in your commercial products?"
You still use burley tobacco in cigarettes?,Yes.
And burley tobacco is an example of a tobacco that typically has a higher nicotine content that a flue-cured tobacco; right?,
Burley tobacco would typically have a higher nicotine content than a flue-cured tobacco?,"I wouldn't say that's true all the time, no. No. It is going to depend on your growing region, what stalk position you take it from, how your agricultural practices have been executed, so there is more to it than that. Now, in a textbook, you are going to see burley may have more than flue-cured than oriental, and that seems to be kind of the I call it the nominal trend, but it doesn't mean it has got more nicotine just because it has got more burley."
"Right. But I think the point I am trying to get to, you just made, and that is Mother Nature may be serving up all of them, but it is up to you as to which one you use in the cigarettes. Some have extremely high nicotine content relative to others, or you could say some have extremely low nicotine content relative to others, depending on type, region, stalk position, and probably a lot of factors I am not even aware of.","Well, those are not the primary factors. The primary factors is how the consumers enjoy smoking their cigarette, because I can use different blends, and that's how we make the foundation of the taste and aroma of a cigarette is the blend of tobaccos, and different cigarettes have different ratios of burley, bright and oriental, and it gives you different taste profiles. In the United Kingdom, they don't like burley, they just like flue-cured."
Right.,"US, it is the complete opposite, so it is taste preference."
"Whether you are designing to taste or otherwise, it will affect, unless by coincidence things come out the same, the nicotine delivery in a cigarette, right, that choice that you make to design to taste?","It -- and there is a lot of things that affect it, but it is how much weight of tobacco is in there is going to depict how much nicotine is in there. That is the primary relationship. Then how much you filter and how much you ventilate will impact how much is in the smoke and how much is inhaled. Maybe this will clean it up. We do not know how much nicotine is in tobacco when we buy it, we don't blend to nicotine, we don't buy to nicotine. So if you don't know how much, you don't change, obviously, so we buy on quality of tobacco."
And that is true historically?,"Over the years, practices may have changed a little bit, but I would say all in all we have no way of knowing how to control the blend for nicotine. It is just too big of a lift. I mean you are dealing with hundreds of millions of pounds of tobacco and the variability all through the system is tremendous. And the biggest contributor to how much nicotine is in a cigarette, how much weight is in a cigarette."
"You have told me earlier you have never seen any Philip Morris document suggesting threshold, I phrased it differently, but threshold nicotine levels for addiction; right?",Correct.
"Have you ever seen a Philip Morris, internal Philip Morris R and D document that discusses a threshold level, for whatever reason, below which nicotine should not be allowed to fall in a commercially marketed cigarette?",I can't recall.
"This says the industry is required to disclose to the FDA information on ingredients and harmful or potentially harmful constituents in regulated tobacco products. Now, you have talked about the list that FDA had of the 25, I think you said it was, and the testing that y'all have done on those; right?",Yes.
"Have you produced a separate list to FDA or are you using FDA's list? See the distinction? This says it can require the industry to disclose information -- oh, never mind. We are talking about the same thing. Right? You don't have to generate your own list of potentially harmful ingredients and constituents; right?","No, we don't have to provide our own list, no. It is what they request us to do."
And number one of two testing changes that you described to me earlier is in response to the second bullet point on Exhibit 10; right? Requires industry to disclose information on ingredients and harmful or potentially harmful constituents?,"Yes, I talked about that as a change, because we weren't testing those at those regimens."
Do you know if Philip Morris has had any public comment on the propriety of the inclusion of the constituents that are on FDA's list of PHCs?,Proprietary?
"Yes. In other words, has Philip Morris said we think this list is great, we think this should come out, we can't believe you said acetaldehyde is potentially addictive, anything like that?","No, I don't think we have said anything like that. I think the list is public now."
It is.,"What the FDA hasn't done is released the information that we have provided to it, which they're required to do."
Right. Has Philip Morris removed any product from the market as a result of FDA regulation?,No.
"I may have asked you this, but has Philip Morris removed any ingredient from any brand of cigarettes based on FDA regulation or FDA action?","No, we have not."
Has Philip Morris changed the nicotine content or delivery -- excuse me -- content of any brand because of FDA regulation?,No.
Has Philip Morris changed nicotine delivery of any product because of FDA regulation?,"No, they have not asked us to, although, with performance standards, they could."
Right. I am trying to draw distinctions between what they can do or what they have done or the practical effects on your work day to day.,Got it.
Has Philip Morris changed any manufacturing techniques due to the FDA regulation?,No.
Has FDA regulation changed the fact that the vast majority of PM's revenues come from traditional combustion cigarettes?,"Has the regulation changed that? No, the regulations have not changed that."
"In other words, that remains true despite regulation?","Well, I think it is a fact that the regulation -- I think you are outside the scope of what regulation can do at that point."
Right.,It can't force you to change your financial income because of a regulation.
Let me ask it a different way. The fact 23 that FDA regulation now exists and has since hasn't changed the fact that Philip Morris continues to earn the vast majority of its revenues through the sale of conventional combustion cigarettes; correct?,"No, it hasn't changed that fact."
Right.,"But certainly, regulation could impact that tremendously as the rules, as the performance standards come down."
Right. It has not yet?,Not to date.
"And, in fact, in looking at Altria's 10-K, there is nothing estimable or probable in that regard because the 10-K actually reports there is nothing on the horizon; correct?","I am not exactly sure -- I would hate to make a statement against our 10-K. I don't know how to dispute or agree with that, I just don't want to state anything that is misleading as an officer of the company."
"Fair enough, and I don't want to be It doesn't say anything on the horizon. Okay. But my point is this, if there is, in Altria's estimation, some probability that FDA regulation is going to substantially impact its ability to earn revenue through the sale of conventional misleading A Q combustion cigarettes, that is something you would expect to see reported in the 10-K; correct?","As just my life experience, the 10-K tries to give forward-looking statements."
Right.,"What the requirements are of the SEC, you are outside of my scope at that point, but that's generally my knowledge of what that is supposed to be doing."
Has Philip Morris instituted any design change in its commercially marketed cigarettes because of FDA action?,"No, we can't. Basically, what we have done is not being able to change anything because of FDA action."
Right. Without approval from the FDA?,That's correct.
And we have talked about modified risk. Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information Redacted I s PM c u r r e n t l y r e s e a r c h i n g n i c o t i n e No. Has it in the past? Yes. Do you know what purpose? For what analogues? A Q A Q purpose?,"From what I have read on the topic, it is similar to what we discussed around denic is the role of nicotine in cardiovascular effects, so my understanding, in reading of the analogue program, was can you have the effect of nicotine without the adverse effect, and the research that we did and published and shared was it goes the other way in essence, it was more negative than where nicotine is today. We shared that with a lot of the members of public health, which I think back in the '80s I think this was."
Do you know whether a nicotine analogue was ever included in any commercially marketed Philip Morris cigarette?,"No, it was not."
"The FDA, if we look finally at number 10, is not authorized to -- I am looking down on the second page of that exhibit -- ban certain specified classes of tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, dissolvables, et cetera, and that's true; correct? That is something the FDA is not authorized to do.",Okay. Hang on. Right.
Maybe the easy thing to do is look at this list of bullet points and tell me if there is any of those you disagree with under what the FDA is not authorized to do.,These are factual statements.
"They're all accurate factual statements, that's my question.",Yes.
"Okay. What is the highest pH you are aware of in the smoke of commercially marketed Marlboros between '67 and '95, if that's a question you have looked at?","I have no idea. We don't look at it on a routine basis. We have done research on it but not something we do routinely. It is not a standard test you would run. There has been people who have proposed certain things and we have done research studies on pH, smoke pH, like I said, some are in my reliance list, but it is not a routine measure."
"And you don't recall, sitting here, the highest pH you would have seen Marlboro reach?",It is not something I look at.
"All right. If you wanted to determine that, how would you determine it?",Determine what?
What the highest pH was in smoke of commercially marketed Marlboros between 1967 and 1995.,"I have no way of knowing that in a way that would be kind of a chronological or annual basis, if you will. We don't generate that type of data."
It would just be an ad hoc search of or a search of ad hoc --,"Yes. I mean you would have to look did we happen to publish a research paper that year and had smoke pH of Marlboro in a red box, it would be ad hoc. It is not something we tested routinely. We don't think it is a test representative of anything because pH is a measure of a liquid. Smoke is not really a liquid. And you never -- you interfere with the equilibrium, so every time you read about smoke and smoke pH, unless the author has kind of given the caveat that this is a reliable, repeatable message, not a good chemist, okay. It is -- it really has to be in a liquid, and it is a reference to something else, so it is not a real absolute test, not a good study, not a good test."
"Is it difficult then or even possible, I guess, for Philip Morris to have tested the pH of its smoke of Marlboro cigarettes at any time?","Yes, there is some in my reliance list."
So how do you then test that?,"Well, there has been proposed tests, but, you know, you can read the papers and say look, what does it really mean to have smoke pH, you got to set it to some form of equilibrium once you dilute it, put it in solution, and what does that mean, a smoke pH once it hits the mouth. There are fantastic buffering properties in the mouth, so what does it really mean. So you can -- Any analytical chemist can write up a method and say, you know, get two parts of this, add one part of that, smoke it for two minutes and collect the smoke and then measure it using this piece of equipment, but the relevance of it is so much meaningless. So, you know, we have done it ourselves and, you know, in my reliance list I think it is Callicutt is a paper that looks at smoke pH and explains it very well. It is actually probably the best explanation of smoke pH"
"So if a lawyer for Philip Morris in trial or a lawyer for our side, for that matter, pulls up an internal Philip Morris document purporting to establish or indicate the pH of the smoke in a Marlboro cigarette at any given point in time in the '70s or '80s, you would consider that an unreliable document?","I don't know if I would consider it unreliable, I would have a lot of questions about the document, okay, how was it conducted, what was the method, how was the aliquot collected, is that consistent from year to year to year, and there is a lot of questions that this type of analysis poses."
But y'all didn't test from year to year to year; right?,"No, no, no, not at all, but one of the things in analytical methodologies is repeatability, right."
"Sure. That would be a frailty with any purported measure of smoke pH, if it is not tested on a routine basis?","That's right. If you are dealing with ad hoc tests, as you do on occasion, then you have certain -- there are certain criteria you really have to follow for analytical test procedures. So I always question smoke pH. You know, you are probably going to find some chemists out there that say oh, as long as you are doing this, this and this, it is an okay method. As much as I have looked at it, it just doesn't make sense."
"You have reviewed a lot of historical documents, you do understand Philip Morris is very interested in the potential for what altering pH might do in terms of delivering nicotine delivery; right?","I certainly know we, as in Philip Morris, have studied pH over the years."
"Philip Morris has never studied pH with the intention of reducing the addictiveness of the cigarettes that it sold to people, that's a true statement; correct?","I think the assumption that is built on is wrong, it assumes that one pH is more addictive than another."
"It assumes nothing of the sort. If the fact is there is no correlation between them whatsoever, my statement remains a true statement, correct, whatever work Philip Morris was doing on pH for whatever reason it was doing it, the one reason we know it was not doing it is to reduce the addictiveness of their products, that's a true statement, is it not?",My same answer applies.
"Okay. The last thing, and it will take two minutes, I hope, and that is you have rebuttal listed in your disclosure. Specifically, Exhibit 2, it says Mr. Jupe may also offer opinions and testimony in response to issues raised by plaintiff and plaintiff's experts and may also be asked to comment on the observations, conclusions or opinions of other expert or fact witnesses, to the extent the testimony of the witness relates to his areas of expertise. Have you reviewed any testimony in this case with the intention of offering rebuttal to it?","No, I have not reviewed anything in this case."
"Okay. So you haven't read depositions from Dr. Cummings, Burns or Hurt?","Until you said that, I didn't know they were in this case."
"That answers that. And the same is true for Dr. Farone, you have only read one of his depositions; correct?",Yes.
And that was the West Virginia case?,Yes.
"All right. Mr. Jupe, I know you have been here for several hours today, I just have a few questions for you. All right.",Okay.
"All right. Your were asked earlier if Philip Morris USA has disclosed to FDA all of its product ingredients, formulas and product specifications; is that right?","Yes, I was asked that, yes, and we have."
"And you were specifically asked if someone at FDA has all of that information, do you recall that question?",Yes.
And I believe the answer you gave was yes.,Yes.
"Did you mean, by your response, that one person at FDA has access to all of Philip Morris's product ingredients, formula and product specifications?","No. Well, let me tell you how it works. I am not sure I understand your question. In that we submit through electronic portal that the FDA sets up, they told us, because we asked a lot of questions up front about this, they told us it is the same type of portal that pharmaceutical companies use to preserve their intellectual property, and so the members of the 10 FDA and Office of Science who are reviewing these applications for compliance for 904 applications, different people have different access to different documents depending on their role. Does that answer your question?"
"I don't think counsel was suggesting this, but I just want to make sure there is no possibility of misunderstanding. I guess what I am asking is, you know, is the FDA taking steps to ensure the continuing protection and secrecy of Philip Morris's trade secrets?","Yes, they do. Yes, they do."
"Is the same thing true of the other agencies to which Philip Morris USA discloses its ingredients, formulas and product specifications, do those other agencies have elaborate security measures in place to protect Philip Morris USA's trade secrets?","Yes, they do."
"Just, for example, the US Department of Health and Human Services has had a lot of Philip Morris USA's trade secret information for decades; is that right?",That's correct.
"And do you know whether the Department of Health and Human Services, like FDA, takes great care to protect PM USA's trade secret information?",Yes. That was part of turning it over.
All right. You were also asked some questions about Philip Morris pointing to the public health community on its website.,"Yes, I was."
Do you recall those questions? Okay. And I think counsel showed you that PM USA on its website says that consumer decision-making about smoking should be guided by the messages of the public health community; is that correct?,That is correct.
Does that statement on Philip Morris's website mean that Philip Morris USA agrees with everything every public health scientist or organization says or publishes?,"No, that doesn't mean we agree with everything every individual says within the public health."
"By pointing consumers to the public health community for guidance in decisions about smoking, does that mean that Philip Morris USA endorses every message by public health organizations or scientists?","No, it doesn't mean we necessarily endorse those messages."
Does Philip Morris USA tell the consumer public when it disagrees with a scientific point or article that a public health organization or scientist might release?,"No, we don't state in public if we disagree with the science about the scientist, we use the scientific forums like journals, peer-reviewed journals, symposium, technical conferences, to debate these types of things, not the public venue."
"Just for the sake of clarity, I think you answered this in response to counsel's questions, but tell us why doesn't Philip Morris USA debate the science with the public health community in full view of the consumer public?","The way I see it, these are difficult scientific issues, and if you are not a scientist and you are not aware of the science with this, it can be perceived as being very confusing. Science, unfortunately, is not as black and white as we would like it to be on many topics, so we don't want it to be a confusion to the public."
"When you come into a courtroom as a witness, do you tell the jury what you really believe about the state of science as it relates to cigarettes and smoking?","The way I see it, is like today, I am under oath, I have got to tell the facts and the truth as I see it, and that's what I do."
"Are you worried when you take the stand as a witness in a trial or at a deposition like this, are you worried about confusing the smoking public by perhaps disagreeing with scientific principles that are laid out in articles or statements by the public health community?","I am not concerned about confusing the public, I see this as a courtroom and conveying the facts and our opinions and our positions on these scientific matters."
"Do you do your very best, when you testify at each trial and each deposition, to tell the truth as completely and accurately as you can?","Well, I tell the truth as accurately as I can."
I think this is my last topic. You were asked a number of questions over the last hour or so about the US Food and Drug Administration. Do you recall those questions?,I do.
"All right. And it may be helpful to you, in responding to my questions on this topic, if you want to look at what counsel has marked as Exhibit 10.",Okay.
"Just in general terms, what is the US Food and Drug Administration?","Well, this is a government entity under the Department of Health and Human Services that has, prior to 2009, oversight and control of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, dog food, I am probably missing a couple, and in 2009 Congress gave them oversight of tobacco."
Is the US Food and Drug Administration a sophisticated scientific agency?,Yes.
What year did President Obama sign into law the statute giving the United States Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate Philip Morris USA and the other tobacco companies?,2009.
Did Philip Morris USA support the law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate it?,"Yes. Philip Morris supported Congress pushing that law through for the President's signature, we did that for about 10 years."
You anticipated my next question.,Sorry.
Philip Morris -- and that's fine. Philip Morris USA supported regulation by the Food and Drug Administration for over 10 years before the law was actually passed?,"It was about 10 years, yes."
Why did Philip Morris USA support the passage of a law to regulate it under the Food and Drug Administration?,"The way I kind of see why we supported them is kind of three fundamental principles, and we spelled that out in our communications: 1, I call it a common set of high standards, performance standards on products, what goes into a product, what comes out of a product, what is said about a product. 2 would be what we discussed today, an MRTP platform, modified risk tobacco, what are the rules, what are the standards that we, as a company, would have to follow to demonstrate a product does indeed reduce the risk. Up until then, there have been no set standard for any of this. Third is clear guidelines for clear communication to consumers, to adult consumers, about the health effects of smoking or the communication of reduced risk products."
Has the regulation of Philip Morris USA by the Food and Drug Administration had any significant implications for the way Philip Morris USA conducts its business?,"Yes, it is significant. I mean my group is involved in this in pretty much a daily basis in that we have had to establish our regulatory affairs division so we have a whole host of people whose job it is for regulatory affairs communications, engagement, reporting, meeting our compliance obligations of product listing and the like and making submissions to FDA for things like substantial equivalence for ingredients reporting as well as hosting the FDA during inspections."
Okay.,So it has been a big change for us.
"I think you mentioned, during counsel's questioning, that the FDA has been here to Richmond to inspect Philip Morris USA's facilities.","Yes, they have."
Have other public health agencies been down to Richmond to inspect your facilities or meet with your scientists since the passage of the FDA bill in 2009?,"Yes, I mean we have had FDA into the building for what they called their site tour program. That wasn't your question, though, you said other entities."
Go ahead.,"So we are involved with the FDA and they come to us to learn about how we produce tobacco and how we produce cigarettes. We have also hosted the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control."
And what is the Centers for Disease Control?,"Basically, another government entity that looks at policies associated with preserving the health of the US population."
When did you host the CDC?,"It was about a month ago, so you had the head of the -- I forget what division Tim McAfee runs, but you had two people from that smoking and health department, whatever it is called, they came down and spoke to our scientists for one day and they requested a tour of our manufacturing."
Did you give them that tour?,"I did, myself and the head of manufacturing."
What areas of the company did you show these officials from the Centers for Disease Control?,"They came through manufacturing, they came through -- essentially, we took them on the FDA tour, so everything the FDA sees, we showed to them."
Did these officials from the Centers for Disease Control request any additional information from you after the tour?,They have been in contact with our folks in regulatory affairs and they have requested some information about our products and what goes in our products.
Okay. Were there any questions that you refused to answer for these CDC officials?,"No. I mean it was a good conversation that I had with Tim McAfee, talking about smoking and smoking health, so it was a very open conversation."
What aspects of Philip Morris USA's business are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration?,"Essentially every aspect with very few exceptions, but everything associated with the production, manufacture, commercialization, marketing of our cigarettes."
Does the Food and Drug Administration have the power to regulate Philip Morris USA's cigarette design?,Yes.
Cigarette manufacturing?,Yes.
Cigarette marketing?,Yes.
How PM USA communicates with smokers?,Yes.
The form and content of warnings on cigarette packages and advertisements?,Yes.
Do you know whether the FDA law prohibits the use of false or misleading labeling and advertising?,"Yes, it does."
Do you know whether the FDA law requires tobacco product manufacturers like Philip Morris USA to secure FDA authorization to market new or modified products?,"Yes, it does. We require market authorization before we introduce a change or a new product to the market."
Does the FDA law require tobacco product manufacturers like Philip Morris USA to secure prior FDA authorization before they market tobacco products that claim to reduce the harm or risk of tobacco-related disease?,"Yes, they do."
Has the Food and Drug Administration since the passage of the bill in 20 0 9 issued regulations requiring proof of age for purchase for consumers of cigarettes?,"Yes, part of their program of the FDA bill is an audit or inspection of retail."
Has FDA issued regulations limiting self service displays for cigarettes?,"Yes, they have."
"Has the FDA issued regulations banning nontobacco items or merchandise bearing cigarette or smokeless tobacco brand names, logos, symbols and so on?","Yes, they have."
"Does the FDA prohibit the use of reduced harm claims including terms like lights, low or mild without a prior FDA order allowing that type of marketing?","Yes, they do prohibit those."
Okay. Does the FDA require Philip Morris USA and others in the tobacco industry to disclose to the FDA its research on the health and dependency effects of tobacco use?,Yes.
Does the FDA also require disclosure of PM USA's marketing data?,Yes.
Does the Food and Drug Administration require Philip Morris USA and others within the industry to disclose to the FDA information on ingredients and harmful or potentially harmful constituents in cigarettes and other regulated tobacco products?,We are required to turn over to the FDA every single ingredient that goes into every single pack and style of our cigarettes as well as what comes out of that cigarette as far as what is in the smoke.
"I just want to be clear on this point, does -- Strike that. Does the FDA have the power to regulate everything that goes into a cigarette?",Absolutely.
Does FDA have the power to regulate everything that comes out of that cigarette?,"Yes, it does."
You were asked some questions about nicotine earlier. Is the FDA studying the question of whether there is a threshold of nicotine in cigarettes that is necessary for addiction?,"Yes. If you look at what the FDA has done, they have established these TCORS, Tobacco Centers of Research Science, I think that's the acronym, Vermont, I think it is Vermont University or Vermont specifically has been awarded a grant for looking at addiction threshold levels to nicotine."
I believe you testified earlier that the FDA is not allowed by law to regulate the levels of nicotine in cigarettes all the way down to zero; is that right?,That's what Congress told them they could not do.
"Okay. Short of regulating nicotine down to zero, can the FDA -- does the FDA have the power to specify whatever level of nicotine in cigarettes it wants?","Yes, that's my understanding, anything but zero."
Is that why the FDA is conducting research at these Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science?,Yes.
All right. Does the FDA regulate how Philip Morris USA communicates with smokers?,"Yes, through the marketing restrictions."
"Did the FDA, following passage of the law in 2009, establish something called the Center for Tobacco Products within the agency?","Yes. Obviously, until the law was passed, there was no Tobacco Center, and so nobody worked on tobacco at the FDA, so since 2009, they have established the center, they have added a head of the 19 center, and by last budget they have about employees at that center."
"You are talking about the center. So within the FDA, there is something called the Center for Tobacco Products; is that right?","Yes, CTP, yes."
How many s c i e n t i s t s o r e m p l o y e e s work a t the Center for Tobacco Products?,"Based on their budget, about 500."
Okay. What kind of work is being done at the Center for Tobacco Products?,"Essentially everything you just asked me. These -- the Center there is really looking at creation of regulations and enforcement of regulations. They're looking at understanding cigarettes and understanding changes to cigarettes and to approve them, funding research through TCORS and with the NIH, so it is an infrastructure that didn't exist with the establishment of performance standards, so everything you just went through is what the CTP has done since June of 200 9."
Did the FDA create something called the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee?,"Yes, TPSAC as we call it."
What is the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee?,"The FDA set up this committee of scientists to essentially advise them on, it sounds redundant, but to advise them on scientific matters, so they have convened this TPSAC meeting on numerous occasions to listen and convey to FDA as well as presenting reports to FDA on certain scientific matters."
Have you attended meetings of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee?,"No, I have not personally, no."
Has the company sent scientists to participate in meetings of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee?,"Yes, on numerous times we have presented to TPSAC."
And what sorts of presentations has Philip Morris USA made to the FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee?,"We have talked to them about menthol, there was a big meeting on menthol, as they were gathering information around menthol and menthol cigarettes, just to give you an example, but we also have meetings with FDA science, Office of Science, that doesn't also go through the TPSAC, to convey information to FDA."
Who pays for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate Philip Morris USA and the other tobacco companies?,"The budget for the FDA is solely set up on what we call user fees, and that's spelled out in the statute, so companies like Philip Morris USA have to pay a user fee for the FDA's budget."
Are taxpayers on the hook for any of the cost of regulating cigarettes by the FDA?,"No, the CTP was set up with user fees as their financial source."
Do you know how much the tobacco industry pays each year in user fees to the Food and Drug Administration?,"If you look at the FDA CTP's budget, you are talking about half a billion dollars, and I think 10 it caps out at about three quarters of a billion, million by 2017."
So does Philip Morris pay these user fees to the FDA every year?,Yes.
And for how long will Philip Morris be obligated to make these user fee payments to the FDA?,"Essentially forever, as long as the CTP is in place."
Does the FDA now have access to all of Philip Morris USA's science and research documents?,"Yes, they have access to it and, if they need more, they can simply ask."
"Has the Food and Drug Administration, since the law was passed in 200 9, asked Philip Morris USA to turn over to it research documents?","Yes, and we have."
Can the Food and Drug Administration seize Philip Morris USA's cigarettes from the company or from wholesale merchants or retail merchants if it deems those products unreasonably dangerous?,"You know, the FDA has got different ways to enforce their regulations, you just mentioned one, they could seize their products, they can shut down our factory, they can stop the sale of certain cigarettes, and so they have a heavy enforcement of this regulation."
Is Philip Morris USA regulated by other government bodies besides the Food and Drug Administration?,"Yes. I mean we have talked about some of those things today, so this is -- The FDA, I would say has the most comprehensive control compared to the others, though."
Okay. Does Philip Morris agree with every aspect of the FDA law that was passed in 2009?,"No, we don't agree with every aspect of the law, and we made that known."
But is Philip Morris committed to cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration and complying with the regulations and rules that are promulgated by the FDA?,"We are committed to being compliant to the rules, there is no question about it."
You were asked a number of questions today about nicotine and addiction and the science surrounding nicotine addiction. Do you consider yourself an expert in the field of nicotine addiction?,"No, I do not."
Or addiction more broadly?,No.
"Well, let me ask you first of all, I want to make sure I understand, the 2009 Act, if I understood your testimony, you said Philip Morris had supported the notion of FDA regulation for 10 years leading up to that Act?","I think it was about 10 years. I have seen communications, meetings since about 2000, so maybe it is closer to 9 years."
"And you understand the Act, one of the first things it did was adopt the regulations that Dr. Kessler had been pushing for back in the '90s; correct?","What it adopted specifically initially, I really don't know. I have not followed the history of that Act."
"Well, let me ask you this: First of all, you understand Philip Morris fought the FDA regulation back in the '90s when Dr. Kessler was pushing for it; correct?","We were opposed to the FDA asserting jurisdiction over tobacco because it was very clean, wasn't it, that Congress did not give them authority over tobacco. So the FDA just couldn't assert jurisdiction, I mean that's very clear, so having Congress pass the law that gave FDA authority is what we supported."
And was that then a business decision on the part of Philip Morris to support it or was that a decision based upon agreement in principle with the motivations that gave rise to the Act of Congress?,"You know, so we are clear, I am certainly not party to what happened as far as what was our reasoning and our rationale, what discussions transpired. I told you -- well, I told Mr. Sexton, in answer to his question, why we supported FDA, so there was probably a lot of factors that went into that."
All three of the reasons you gave would have been true under Dr. Kessler's proposed regulations with FDA; right?,"They may have been true, but I mean the fact remains that the FDA just didn't have legal jurisdiction."
"Well, why didn't Philip Morris just step up and say we will work with you and make this happen if it was -- if these are the guiding principles that prompted your cooperation with the FDA to begin with, 19 why didn't they prompt the same cooperation 5 years, years before?","You know, I don't know. As I said, I wasn't in the room having those types of discussion, but I can tell you since about 2000, that's when we have been supporting FDA control of our business."
"So something happened between 1996 and 2000 at Philip Morris to change the position, correct, from one of opposition to one of support and acceptance?",And you are talking about opposition to FDA?
"Yes, sir.","Yes, we talked about a lot of our positional changes within the company in that time frame, so there were a lot of factors that led to our support of FDA and changing company position."
"You have had -- You have talked a good bit about some of the authority of the FDA, and I am not going to go back over how that has translated into action, we have already talked about that, but I do want to talk about what motivated the passage of the Act and find out how much Philip Morris agrees or disagrees with in that regard.",Sure.
"Since you laid out the reasons or the principles that prompted Philip Morris to agree and cooperate with FDA, I would like to see in detail which ones Philip Morris agrees or doesn't agree with. If you look in the Congressional findings -- you have read the Act, I am sure, since you are testifying on it?","I have read the Act, yes."
So you have read Section 2 which includes the Congressional findings; right?,"Yes, the preamble, which is really not part of the Act, is it?"
"Well, no, it is certainly part of the Act. It is a legal enactment. The second section of the legal enactment is entitled Findings, and it states --",Okay.
-- that Congress finds the following. You have read that; correct?,I know what you are talking about.
My original question was you have read this; right?,"I have r e a d i t , y e s , I h a v e ."
The Congressional findings?,"The preamble, yes."
"Number 5, Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute significantly to the use of nicotine-containing products by adolescents. That is a Congressional finding that was one of the bases for prompting regulation; correct, as articulated in the statute.","You know, as far as the foundation for that, I mean maybe Congress used that as part of the preamble, I don't know what they relied on to come to that -- it never really spelled out what they used as unique information, I have always had that type of question with these Congressional findings."
So does Philip Morris agree or disagree with that statement?,I don't know our position on that.
Okay.,This is advertising and marketing.
"And you would agree -- well, I mean we are talking about clear guidelines on communication, that was one of the principles that you said Philip Morris was after, this is certainly addressing that principle, is it not?","We certainly agree the principle of clear concise communication to adult smokers. All right. You know, I don't think this is something that we would agree or disagree with, I just don't know."
"Would Philip Morris agree that if it is true, that tobacco advertising and marketing contributes significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products by adolescents, that would be a compelling reason to regulate the industry, wouldn't it?","We certainly agree that adolescents shouldn't smoke, okay. We market our products the best we can to adults, okay. I don't know of any way that we can ever ever preclude adolescents from seeing that, but our intent is to market to adults."
"Right. My question was not about how Philip Morris intends to market its products, the jury will see evidence on that, historically at least. My question is if finding number 5 by the US Congress is true, and you have told me, I believe, Philip Morris -- you don't know if it even has a position on whether that is true. If it is true, Philip Morris would agree, would it not, that's a compelling reason to regulate the cigarette industry?","I think I have answered your question. I told you why we supported the bill. Okay. Now to go into that finding in an area that, as I said, is not an area of where that information derived from, okay, so FDA -- if you look at the name of the bill, right, the Family Smoking Prevention Act, so we agree with that bill, we agree with that kids shouldn't smoke. If our marketing is influencing adolescents, then better controls, better regulations, you know, I personally think that's great."
Good.,We don't want kids to smoke.
"Good. We don't either. Number 6, Congress finds because past efforts to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed. That's a Congressional finding. Do you know whether PM agrees or disagrees with that finding?",I don't know what our position is on that one.
Do you know whether that was one of the reasons that prompted Philip Morris to support the regulation?,"As I told you, these are the three fundamental reasons why we supported this type of regulation."
"Well, sure, and this would facilitate, would it not, clear guidelines on communication, particularly to kids, through advertising; correct?","Again, our intent is not to advertise to kids."
"I understand. I am just trying to find out if, when you say that clear guidelines on communication is one of the things that Philip Morris, one of the incentives it had to support, does that extend to the Congressional finding that their attempted restrictions on your advertising and marketing to kids in the past had failed to curb adolescent tobacco use?",
Does it include that?,"Again, you are talking about -- Look, it is communication. I mean that's the theme here, isn't it, the theme is clear concise communication. All right. Does it wrap into their confusing information, does it wrap into their inadvertent adolescents reviewing marketing information and what their takeaway of that is? It is communication. Okay. Can we better control communication, that is what we are supporting. Whether it is to adolescents or adults, can we control that better, that's why we are supporting FDA."
"Okay. So to the extent 5 and 6 would facilitate that sort of clear communication, you, Philip Morris, would agree with the Congressional purposes behind the Act, do I understand that?",I don't think we would agree or disagree. I am just saying because it pertains to communication doesn't mean we agree with the way that that's worded.
"Okay. And that's This is kind of like when we talked about the role of nicotine and you have got these sort of three platforms, three sort of big picture reasons that you have given why Philip Morris supported. I am trying to find out what is underneath those. I mean I understand them at face value. I am trying to find out, if I scratch the surface a little bit, what is underneath there, and I am trying to do it through -- that is all, of course, just narrative. There is no question based on that. But I want you to understand why I am asking these questions, and I am sure you do. Philip Morris may have supported the FDA and Congress in regulating the industry, but it didn't come about through Philip Morris's goodwill; correct? The US Congress found there was a need to regulate this industry because this industry was causing social harm; correct?","I wouldn't characterize it as a need. I mean when you think about all the products that the FDA regulates and we are the only type of product, it was a logical addition to the FDA portfolio, if you will."
The US Congress says Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and regulatory authority and resources they need to address comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused by the use of tobacco products; correct? That is one of the incentives for regulating the industry is because you sell a product that causes societal problems; right?,"Again, there is no question our product is a dangerous product, it is an inherently dangerous product, but you are asking me very specific questions on these findings, whose foundation is just lacking unto themselves. I mean there wasn't a Congressional -- Where is the Congressional record that looked into these comments? It is interesting, but it doesn't exist. They're almost adopted statements from somebody. It is almost a misnomer to call them a Congressional finding. Do you understand my point? I mean it is always perplexing to me --"
"Sure, and I won't argue with you about it. Congress called them findings.","Yes, that's the label."
"Right, it is, that Congress put on its own Act that you say Philip Morris supports, and I am going to explore a few more of them, because I want to find out where we end up. We may actually agree on one, I am guessing, number 13 says -- excuse me -- number 8, Federal and State public health officials, the public health community, and the public at large recognize that the tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight. That is something Philip Morris agreed with; correct?","We support control of our industry, yes."
"Which includes ongoing oversight, much of which you just described for Mr. Sexton; right?","Control, oversight, regulation, all of those."
"Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking, that is a Congressional finding that prompted passage of the Act. Is that something -- a concern that Philip Morris shared when it expressed its support for the Act?","Again, we supported the Act on those principles, there is no question that smoking causes disease and death, okay, and --"
Do you quarrel with the numbers that Congress used?,
I am sorry. I thought you were done.,"You know, I am not going to sit here and quarrel with those numbers of 400,000 deaths a year, these are the numbers that the CDC generates, they seem very consistent with the CDC. So control of our industry, again, the theme here is we wanted control of our industry, how we make cigarettes and how we communicate cigarettes, okay, and how to demonstrate reduction in the risk of cigarettes. Why? Because we want to have an impact on public health too."
"Number 15, Congress found that advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco products have been especially directed to attract young persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful in adequately preventing such increased use. Is that a legitimate concern in attempting to regulate the industry as Congress did?","I wouldn't classify it as a concern. I don't think we advertise to adolescents. You know, I work for the company and I see our advertising, I have been here for the last 18 years, and I don't see that. Is it a criticism? Yes, it has been a criticism. So having control by the FDA of how we communicate, how we advertise, will it take that criticism away."
"So that would be, I guess, something Philip Morris would agree with is it would at least take away the criticism that Philip Morris has been targeting kids with advertising and marketing regardless of the truth of the allegation?",
Is that fair?,"I think you are right in saying it may reduce the criticism, because the truth is we haven't been targeting youth."
"I am sorry. I am trying to keep tally. Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and healthful to minors. I take it, from our last conversation, you disagree with that?","Again, another criticism that we face, another criticism of -- to me, that connects with descriptors, things like lights, things we have been asking guidance on for a long time, because it is the same Federal government that was endorsing lights for many years, so you can see the necessity to have that referee to have that common standard of how we communicate."
"Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the number of young people who begin to use tobacco. Is that a concern that Philip Morris shared when it supported FDA implementation of the Act?","Again, this is an area I don't work in, Mr. Schultz. I mean you keep asking me about advertising. I certainly know it generally is a criticism, but I don't -- but it is not what I would consider the rationale for supporting the Act. I keep going back and answering your question --"
"It is fine, if it is the same answer.",It is the same answer. It is clear communication.
Okay.,We don't want to communicate to adolescents.
"Right, and Congress doesn't either, and I don't want to argue with you about it, but if you are going to get up and tell this jury these are the reasons that Philip Morris supports FDA regulation, I want to find out what that means when we look at the reasons Congress gave for the regulation, and if the answer is I don't know, we think they're wrong, we support them a hundred percent, I am fine with any of those, I just want to know what it is, and I understand it is tedious, but there is only one way to do it.",Of course.
"Do you recognize by the way, the one that we just went through, some of that language from the '94 Surgeon General's report?",
"Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the number of young people who begin to use tobacco. Have you ever read the '94 Surgeon General's report?","I have read the report. Whether that was in there verbatim, I don't know. I don't recall."
"Okay. No, it was not in there verbatim, but the principle underlying it, are you familiar with that from the '94 report?",You are taxing my memory on that. I just don't recall.
"I am just wondering if you thought this too was a baseless finding or if it was something that might have scientific support. Have you read, for example, monograph 19, NCI monograph 19?","What year was that, do you remember?"
I believe it was 2010.,Yes. Yes.
Do you know if that's on your reliance list?,"I don't think it is, no."
Do you know if the '94 Surgeon General's report is on your reliance list?,Good question. I can look.
"It doesn't matter either way. You have told me that you have looked at it. Have you looked at it enough to know whether the '94 Surgeon General's report would offer support for this finding by Congress, the one I just read?",I don't know how to answer that question. I just don't remember enough of the '94 report to give you a solid response.
The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and encourages them to use tobacco products. That's a Congressional finding. Is that something that Philip Morris -- a concern that Philip Morris would have shared in prompting it to support regulation?,"Well, I think by that time we were not using products in that type of media, right. That was something that we agreed not to do since 1998 in the MSA, if you are talking about product placement in movies."
"So the answer is no, that's not a concern Philip Morris had because you weren't doing it?","We were not doing it at the time that the Congress passed that Act. It had already stopped, it had already gone."
Under the MSA?,Under the MSA.
A few more. Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including tobacco use by young people. That is actually a statement Philip Morris disagrees with and disagrees with today; correct?,"Well, it is a little ambiguous, isn't it? I mean if you think about it, increases the tobacco market. I mean, first of all, it is not a fact, the number of people smoking and the percent of the population smoking is declining every year in the United States, so it is not factual."
Okay. So you disagree with that?,"Yes, there is no question about it --"
"Historically, Philip Morris disagrees also that tobacco advertising leads to primary use; right?","Again, you are asking me questions about advertising, I don't know the answer."
"That's fair enough. And it is your understanding that the number of smokers, hard number of smokers today is -- let's take a year. 1967, the year Lamar Danielson started smoking, it is your understanding there are fewer smokers in the USA today than there were in 1967 when he started smoking?","You are taxing me on -- if you would have asked me to look that up before I got here, I could have. I just don't know those numbers, Mr. Schultz."
"Tobacco company documents indicate that young people are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices. Another Congressional finding. Do you know whether Philip Morris embraced that finding in supporting FDA regulation?","Again, it is another criticism that we faced and it is another topic of clear communication."
Has anyone shown you Philip Morris documents where Philip Morris indicates internally the importance of children to the long-term survival of its brands?,I haven't seen those.
Would you like to see them?,"Again, this is not an area that I plan on testifying again, so as far as advertising, nor is it an area I studied, so I think it would be completely out of context."
"Well, it would be support, would it not, for this finding. I mean is this a finding -- you have told me it is a criticism that has been leveled, you have mentioned a couple of these findings are baseless. Do you think that one is baseless?","I really don't have an opinion either way on that one, I just don't know, I have not studied that area."
Okay.,"I mean when it comes to marketing and advertising, I understand the constraints that we have because of MSA, I understand the constraints of regulations of FDA, but I have not studied the history of marketing and advertising as I have done of cigarette and cigarette design."
"If I show you documents from the internal vault at Philip Morris during the lifetime of my client showing that Philip Morris believed that young people are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco market, which I can show you, will you agree with me this is a compelling reason to regulate Philip Morris?",I don't think I can base an opinion on one document.
It will be more than one document.,I don't think I can base my opinion on that. I mean it is an unfair question to kind of pose to me because it is outside of my area of expertise.
"Congress found, in passage of the Act, that permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would be detrimental to the public health. Now, this touches on the standards and compliance prongs I think that you mentioned from Philip Morris's platform, if you will. Is this a concern then that Philip Morris would have shared in supporting regulation?","Again, fundamentally that is a criticism that has been made of us, and, again, that is a clear principle why of which we wanted oversight, so we can communicate reduced risk products in a way that is supported by regulation and is supported by the science, and that is -- not to mince the words, but that's pretty close to what we are saying there, we want clear communication of reduced risk products based on a standard."
And that desire came about when in relation to Philip Morris's policy change on whether smoking caused disease and was addictive?,"When, you mean like time wise?"
Before or after?,"Well, I would say during. I mean I am not sure there is a specific date to associate that with, but it is what I said earlier, as far as low tar cigarettes. The same Federal Government supported and endorsed low tar cigarettes. They did for many years, maybe decades, and we produced them, we called them lights, we called them low tar, and then we were criticized for making claims. All right. And so we don't want -- certainly, we don't want another situation where we are trying to do the right thing, 10 the government supports what we are doing and then years later tell us that we did something wrong."
When was the criticism of the lights that you are referring to?,It started in about 2001.
Is that when Philip Morris's desire for regulation for consistency and standards and so forth came about?,"Again, you are asking me a specific point in time, but if you look through the '90s, there was certain criticism of lights and low tar either through the Surgeon General or through the monograph series, and then monograph 13, I kind of see that as the change of position of the government. Up until then, there was still an endorsement of low tar cigarettes. And so we tried to reduce the risk through a dose response approach and then, after the fact, we were criticized heavily for doing that, which was a product and a position that the government endorsed for many years, so you can see the need for us to have these common sets of standards, otherwise, we feel that we might get criticized again, if we ever introduce a cigarette or a tobacco product that we believe is a reduced risk product."
And it is your -- Philip Morris's appreciation of the historical situation that public health was criticizing it for attempting to reduce the risks of smoking?,
I believe that's what you said. I want to be clear.,"No, I didn't say that. I am just saying that we were criticized in 2001 that these products were not reducing the risk, therefore, we must have been doing something wrong. That's essentially the argument in 2013, excuse me, 2001's monograph 13."
"There had been criticisms of the industry, of course, and the use of light descriptors before that that had not prompted Philip Morris to seek out FDA regulation; correct?","As I said, during the '90s, the Surgeon General and the monograph series started to look into this area, but I use 2001 as kind of a pinnacle."
Right. There were criticisms in the 1990s of lights and use of lights as descriptors and all that went with that; right?,Absolutely.
"That did not prompt Philip Morris to go to the FDA and say look, we want regulation in order to resolve this issue. In fact, you were contesting FDA regulation at the very time those criticisms of lights were going on; right?","We went to the FTC, who were regulating us at that point."
You went to the FTC on what?,In regards to direction on low tar and lights issues.
"Right. You did not go out and seek out FDA regulation on descriptors and standards for modified risk tobacco products, none of that came about in the '90s because of criticism of lights; right?","I was going to say the real -- if my memory serves me correctly, we are talking late '90s, we are talking 2000 as far as support of FDA, we are talking working with the Institute of Medicine during that time frame, and part of the principles that they put together as far as a governance of tobacco was the need for a regulatory body, ergo the FDA."
Let me -- I am sorry.,"No, that's it."
"Let me ask it this way: When is the first time that you are aware that Philip Morris publicly announced, and by publicly I mean outside of the walls of Philip Morris, announced a desire or need to be regulated by Congressional Act or FDA?","I would have to say in around 2000, and I can't recall the exact circumstance, whether it was a Congressional letter or Congressional meeting or communication."
"Do you know if that is on your reliance list, any evidence of that first communication or, if so, what it would be?","No, I don't believe it is on my reliance list."
"Congressional finding 47, in August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies continue to target and market to youth, citing the USA vs. Philip Morris case, of course, with Judge Kessler. Philip Morris doesn't dispute that was a finding, I trust.",I don't know PM's position on that.
Okay. Are you familiar with that case?,"Some, to some degree."
Did you testify?,No.
Do you know who testified on the subject matters that you testify on in these cases back in the DOJ case?,"No, I do not."
"Number 48, next to the last, in August 200 6, a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies dramatically increased their advertising and promotional spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998. That is a Congressional finding in support of passage of the Act that Philip Morris supports. Does Philip Morris support that rationale for passing the Act?",I don't know our position on that finding
"There is one more, that the same US district court judge found that you have designed cigarettes to precisely control nicotine delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of your nicotine-related research. I know, from discussions with you today, you disagree with that; correct?","I know how I design cigarettes, okay, and I don't do it in that manner."
"So let me ask you, because she is looking back retrospectively, does Philip Morris agree or disagree with that finding?","Again, you are asking me positional statements on sentences, and I don't think we, as a company, have positions on sentences. Okay. I told you why we supported the passage of the bill and those principles based on criticisms we have received and areas that we want to do better in, and I don't know how to convey that any clearer that we, as a company, don't have positions on every sentence in the Act."
"And so you can appreciate where I am going, I mean y'all have three reasons that you have articulated, some of which may be embraced in here, Congress set forth 4 9 findings in support of the Act, and our jury may want to know which ones Philip Morris does or doesn't agree with, and maybe you will know at trial and maybe you won't and maybe it won't change, but I would expect to be asked, if you come to testify, that's why I brought it up.","But, as I said, we do agree with Congress that FDA should have oversight and control of the tobacco industry."
All right. The CDC visit,Yes.
"-- last month, was that pursuant to the Act or was that something separate?",Something separate.
"Okay. Oh, user fees, Philip Morris supports the notion of Philip Morris and the other manufacturers paying for regulation of the industry; correct?",Yes.
"I mean when you say you support the Act, you support user fees as well; right?",We support the Act and user fees are part of the Act.
"R i g h t . P h i l i p M o r r i s d o e s n ' t t a k e t h e position should it -- does it, that the American taxpayer should bear the tax burden for having to regulate an industry that Congress found did the things that Congress found?",
That's not Philip Morris's position; right?,I don't know of any Philip Morris position on the funding of the FDA.
