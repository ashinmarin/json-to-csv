                        "answer": "Sure. In a general sense, starting back in 2009, I held the regulatory affairs function and group for Altria Client Services to support our regulated tobacco operating companies. I worked with and continue to work with people inside the company to help them understand the FDA's regulatory requirements and what the law says and help to communicate about that internally, help to build training and education about that internally, and then I work closely with and interact with the Food and Drug Administration itself to provide them information and to meet with them and to kind of work with them as they implement the regulatory authority."

                        "answer": "The law that granted the Food and Drug Administration that authority went into effect in June of 2009. So since the summer of 2009, FDA has had the authority to regulate tobacco products, including Philip Morris USA."

                        "answer": "Well, it really regulates all aspects of Philip Morris's business from the products itself and how they are manufactured to how the products -- what we can say about the products, and even how the products themselves are sold."

                        "question": "With regard to the first area, the products and how they are manufactured, can you 3 describe what the FDA has done in its regulation of Philip Morris's products, Philip Morris USA's products and how they are manufactured? http://www.phippsreporting.com",
                        "answer": "Sure. There are a number of things, but I can give you some examples. So FDA required the companies, including Philip Morris, to register all of its manufacturing centers and provide a list of all the products that it manufacturers and sells and distributes, required that companies provide extensive ingredient information, established a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents and required testing and reporting of those constituents. And in the manufacturing world specifically, they have the authority and have conducted inspections."

                    {
                        "question": "With regard to the second area that you mentioned, which I believe you said was what Philip Morris can say about its products, what has the FDA done to regulate Philip Morris USA's marketing of its cigarettes?",
                        "answer": "So they have implemented a number of 0 things that maybe a good example to explain what I'm talking about is that there was a provision in the law that went into effect in 2010 that required the removal of descriptors, words that previously were on cigarette packs like low, mild, medium, so forth. Those were required to be removed. http://www.phippsreporting.com And FDA, it has authority over statements the company makes if it were to make some kind of a claim about a product, it would need FDA's authorization to be able to do that."
                    },
                    {
                        "question": "And as to the third area of Philip Morris USA's business that the FDA regulates, what has the FDA done to regulate how Philip Morris USA cigarettes are sold?",
                        "answer": "Again, there are a couple of examples that come to mind for that. One requirement that was in the law that's been implemented was that all tobacco products need to be sold in a clerk-assisted manner, which sometimes is referred to in a non-self-service manner, so, in other words, for a consumer that wants to purchase it, they need to ask a clerk to actually get the product and provide it to them for the transaction. So that went into place. And FDA has also developed they have entered into contracts with state officials to conduct inspections at retail to ensure that products are being sold to adults and that they are not being sold to youth. And they have retailer enforcement actions that they follow to conduct those inspections and assess compliance with the law at retail. http://www.phippsreporting.com"

                    {
                        "question": "Now, in addition to the areas that you have already described, can the FDA also require Philip Morris USA to provide the FDA information about its business?",
                        "answer": "Yes, it can."
                    },
                    {
                        "question": "What types of information?",
                        "answer": "Really they can ask for any type of information that they think is important. They can ask for detailed information about the products themselves, you know, beyond the things I have already mentioned- They can ask for documents, if they have a particular topic that they are interested in, so, for example, if they ask for tobacco and health-related documents that the companies had. So they really have the ability to ask for information across any of the areas that they have regulatory authority that I described."

                    {
                        "question": "You mentioned inspections. Does the FDA have authority to conduct inspections of Philip Morris USA's facilities?",
                        "answer": "They do. They have, they have the authority to do it. In fact, they are actually required to conduct inspections at least once every two-year cycle. They have already -- they have http://www.phippsreporting.com already conducted inspections. They did the first cycle, and they are on their second cycle of actually conducting inspections."
                    },
                    {
                        "question": "Can you please describe what happens when the FDA inspects one of Philip Morris USA's facilities in general terms?",
                        "answer": "Sure. In a general sense, there are unannounced inspections, meaning that the FDA literally just decides to show up at a manufacturing facility and they have done this at Philip Morris's facility is where they show up and knock on the door and say we're here and we would like to conduct an inspection. What happens then is that the company obviously brings them in and finds out what they are interested in, what they would like to see, takes them on a tour of the manufacturing facility, answers questions that they may have, provides documentation if they are looking for documentation. So it really gives FDA the full access to the manufacturing facility and to the leadership at the manufacturing facility to, again, take them on a tour and answer questions that provide information. 4 Q. Is the FDA also authorized to collect information from Philip Morris USA about the http://www.phippsreporting.com ingredients in its cigarettes?"

                    {
                        "question": "Did Congress give the FDA authority to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act if one of the tobacco companies isn't complying with the law?",
                        "answer": "It did. FDA actually has fairly extensive enforcement authorities as well, so, for example, if during the course of an inspection of any manufacturing facility, if FDA determined that there was some particular problem or something that was a significant concern to them, they could, they could shut down a manufacturing facility right there on the spot. And it would remain closed until FDA determined it could be reopened. They have the ability to order you to stop selling a product, if they have a basis for, for doing that and believing that it shouldn't be in the marketplace. They can order a product to be seized and destroyed. They can impose fines and penalties, so they have a variety of enforcement methods. 4 Q. Where does the money come from to fund the FDA's regulation of the tobacco industry? http://www.phippsreporting.com"

                        "answer": "No."

                    {
                        "question": "One final area with respect to the FDA. Did Philip Morris USA support Congress's efforts to give the FDA authority to regulate the tobacco industry?",
                        "answer": "Yes. We did, actually, support that for quite a number of years. I think I made mention of this in the earlier testimony, but in the year 2000, the company announced its support for FDA regulation and then worked actively over the course of the eight and a half, almost nine years until it passed Congress to encourage Congress to actually enact that law. 4 Q.

And then over time continued to add, you know, people to do that work, generally brought in from other parts of the company who were doing similar work, and over time when I joined the group, I think I was the third person to join the Regulatory Affairs Group. And then over time as we, you know, learned and identified what work needed to be done, we built that out, you know, kind of like you would do any other department in a company to identify the people that we needed and the types of skill sets that we needed and things like that. http://www.phippsreporting.com to review 2014? testimony extent you with any privileged By the way, did you have the opportunity your deposition transcript from June 19, Yes, I did.

I can give you my personal perspective, just, you know, kind of thinking back to that time frame. In a general sense, it is largely because it is kind of comparable to what the FDA does for other products. I mean, they have fairly broad regulatory authority to do the kinds of things I was describing for tobacco products, for food products, and medical devices and drugs and so forth. So in some respects, the way that I think about it was it was, you know, consistent with FDA's authority and approach on other products."

And so I can answer your question about, about that, which is, yes, the company was opposed to that effort back at that time frame in the mid-1990s because it was, you know, as I understand it, a very different approach to regulation in at least a couple of ways. One of them was that Congress didn't 0 grant FDA that authority, it didn't deliberate and pass a law that provided FDA that authority first. And then, secondly, I believe that that attempt back in the 1990s was to regulate tobacco products to a medical device standard as opposed to, you know, for an agricultural -based product that they are. http://www.phippsreporting.com And so the support in 2000 was based on developing a regulation that's appropriate for tobacco products as agricultural-based products and doing that through the congressional processes."
