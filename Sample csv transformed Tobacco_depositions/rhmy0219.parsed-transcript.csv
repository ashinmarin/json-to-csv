question,answer,Declarative_Text
"Dr. Sarkar, as you know, my name is Ron Cabaniss. We're convening for the resumption of your deposition at this time. And as I have no further questions of you, thank you for your time previously. And I will pass the witness.",Okay.
"Good morning, Dr. Sarkar. Could you please state your current position.",Yes. I am a senior principal scientist at Altria Client Services.
"In that position, do you provide services to Philip Morris USA?","Yes, I do."
How long have you held your current in posit A Q mentioned the Adminis Philip Philip Philip,"So when the President signed into law the FSPTCA, it gave FDA broad regulatory authority over the company Philip Morris USA and products it makes. But it generally can be categorized into they have regulatory authority over the design of our cigarettes, manufacturing of our cigarettes, marketing of our cigarettes, as well as sales."
Can you describe what the FDA has done in its regulation of the design of Philip Morris USA's cigarettes?,"Amongst other things, and specifically around the design of the cigarettes, there are several regulating authorities. And I generally for example, with the cigarette design, we would have to report to FDA the ingredients that we put in our cigarettes. We also have to report the levels of the constituents, harmful and potentially harmful constituents that are emitted from our cigarettes. In the design space, FDA also has broad authority over establishing product standards so they can, for example, regulate levels of tar and nicotine, if they deem it appropriate for the protection of public health. Also important to the cigarette design, FDA has required manufacturers to inform them if there are any changes that we make to our product. And depending on the levels of changes, the FDA has carved out three kind of pathways that they would review the scientific evidence. So if we change the products a little bit, it will probably go through a substantial equivalence to demonstrate we have a substantial equivalence. If not, we have to submit the scientific evidence around a new product application. And there is a substantial level of evidence that we would have to provide to demonstrate that it's appropriate for the protection of public health. And the third pathway, which is to demonstrate if we have a product that is lower risk, that's called a modified risk tobacco product application. And, once again, we have to submit evidence to FDA to get authorization to put these products on the market. So, bottom line, we now have to inform FDA and get permission and authorization from FDA if we make any changes in the cigarette design."
You also mentioned manufacturing as an area that the FDA regulates. What has the FDA done in regulating Philip Morris USA's manufacturing of its cigarettes?,"With manufacturing, one of the first things that we have to do is register the manufacturing facilities with FDA on an annual basis. And FDA can come and inspect these facilities on a regular basis every two years. As a matter of fact, they have come and inspected our manufacturing facilities. Also with the manufacturing, FDA is going to establish what's called good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, to establish kind of a common set of standards for not only us, but for others in the industry."
You mentioned that the FDA regulates marketing of cigarettes. What has the FDA done to regulate Philip Morris USA's marketing of its cigarettes?,"Specifically around marketing, FDA has jurisdiction and enforces regulating authority, starting by banning the use of descriptors, like ""lights"" and ""mild."" And, you know, for marketing, it also has authority over our marketing research. They can ask us to produce our consumer research. Along with that, they also can ask us to produce documents related to the health effects, any studies that we have done on the products. Furthermore, with the marketing in the marketing space, they have the authority to also look at the graphic warnings and the warnings on our products. And they have, you know, imposed a new set of warnings for cigarettes."
"You mentioned that the law banned the use of descriptors. When you talk about descriptors, what are you referring to?","What I was specifically referring to is that FDA, as soon as the law was signed and had the imposed its enforcement, it gave the manufacturer two years to stop making cigarettes with any descriptors, like ""lights"" or ""ultra light"" or ""mild,"" or any descriptors that distinguish the taste profile of the cigarettes."
"Today does Philip Morris USA manufacture and sell any cigarettes with the ""Lights"" name on them?","No, we do not manufacture since I believe 2010, we do not manufacture any packs with the descriptors on them."
So are there any cigarettes that Philip Morris USA manufactures and markets today that are called Marlboro Lights?,No.
What has the FDA done to regulate how Philip Morris USA cigarettes are sold?,"With that, too, FDA has a broad enforcement authority. And amongst other things, they restrict the sale to minors. It's illegal to sell to minors. They have imposed regulations around, you know, the sale should be behind the counter and face-to-face interactions and, also, you know, banned the use of the brand names for any sponsored events, et cetera."
"In addition to the areas of regulation that you've already described, can the FDA also require Philip Morris USA to provide information about its business to the FDA?","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, they can ask manufacturers not only to provide the specific information about the ingredients and constituents, but also require to disclose documents on health related issues around products as well as m a r k e t i n g ."
Does the FDA have authority to conduct inspections of Philip Morris USA's facilities?,"Yes, indeed. As we were talking about a minute ago, that FDA has already conducted inspections of our manufacturing facilities."
Can you describe a typical inspection at a Philip Morris USA facility?,"Yes. It's actually an interesting scenario, because they just show up at our doorstep unannounced. And usually it's a team of inspectors that are deployed and, you know, they just knock on our door. And we have to open up the manufacturing facility and provide to them any supporting documents that they deem necessary for them to conduct the inspections. And these inspections are very thorough. And they go through and walk through our manufacturing facilities, they review our standard operating procedures, and in some instances, they can stay on site as long as they've gotten all the questions answered. So in this instance, they stayed at the Philip Morris USA manufacturing facility for almost a week."
Did Congress give the FDA authority to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act if one of the tobacco companies isn't complying with the law?,"Yes, indeed. So, you know, FDA has broad ranging enforcement authority and, you know, we have to comply with that. Otherwise, there are consequences."
What consequences or enforcement tools does the FDA have available to it?,"Amongst other things, as we've talked about, if they are doing an inspection, let's say if they find anything amiss, they can shut down the factory. And at the other end, if there are any issues with the products, they can ask manufacturers to recall the products. They can even ask manufacturers to provide samples of the products. And in some instances, there are stiff penalties. And remember I was mentioning to you about the sales piece. At the sales point of sales, if the stores are found to be selling products to minors without evidence or proof of age, there are stiff penalties associated with the store owners as well. So they have very broad ranging enforcement authorities and they exercise that on a regular basis."
"Dr. Sarkar, where does the money come from to fund the FDA regulation of the tobacco industry?","So when the bill was enacted, one of the first things that the FDA did was set up the Center for Tobacco Products. The Center for Tobacco Products then assessed what's called user fees. And these user fees are based on market sales and proportion sales for each manufacturer. So the Center for Tobacco Products was built upon or based on the user fees."
"Just so we're clear, are user fees paid by the manufacturers, including Philip Morris USA?",Yes. Yes. Right now FDA has got close to 500 employees and all the infrastructure that's been created around the Center for Tobacco Products is supported through the user fees that Philip Morris USA and other manufacturers pay.
Are tax dollars paid by tax payers used to fund the FDA regulation of the tobacco i n d u s t r y ?,No. The Center for Tobacco Products is funded by the user fees.
One final area with respect to the FDA. Did Philip Morris USA support Congress's efforts to give the FDA authority to regulate the tobacco industry?,"Yes. You know, we have been in support of FDA regulation for almost a decade, even before the bill was signed into law in 2009."
Can you please describe Philip Morris USA's support for FDA regulation in general terms?,"Generally speaking, we were very interested in developing reduced-harm products and we wanted to be able to have a regulatory framework to assess those reduced-harm products. As a matter of fact, that was one of the main reasons that we were, you know, encouraging FDA regulation. And even as early as the bill was being signed, our CEO, Mr. Szymanczyk sent a letter to the President in support of this regulation. You know, in addition to this framework for assessing these lower-risk products, we also wanted to have a common set of high standards for manufacturing and furthermore also allow FDA to develop for, you know, clear communication to the consumers about the health effects of our products."
"Dr. Sarkar, does the FDA regulate what goes into the Philip Morris USA cigarettes?","Yes. As I mentioned to you in the design space, we have to inform FDA about all ingredients, everything we add to our products, yes."
Does the FDA regulate what comes out of Philip Morris USA cigarettes?,"Yes, that's correct. You know, once again, they have actually gone through an elaborate process of establishing a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents. And manufacturers like Philip Morris USA would have to report the levels of the different constituents and the different testing conditions. 2 BY MR. SNAPP:"
Does the FDA regulate what Philip Morris USA can say in its marketing materials and on its packs about its cigarettes?,"Y e s . Y e s , i n d e e d . As we mentioned earlier, they've already banned the use of the word descriptors. But in addition, they monitor the Web sites, they have a say in the health warnings, et cetera. So, yes, they do."
"Dr. Sarkar, I want to turn to a different topic. Earlier in the deposition, you testified that at PM USA or Philip Morris USA, in the R&D department, there were some scientists who had opinions about the addiction potential of nicotine. Do you remember that testimony?",
"Dr. Sarkar, earlier in the 19 deposition I'm referring to the page 89, lines through 20 of your prior deposition.",
"Earlier in the deposition, Dr. Sarkar I'm referring specifically to page 89, lines 5 through 20 of the transcript you testified that at PM USA in the R&D department, there were some scientists who had opinions about the addiction potential of nicotine. Do you remember that testimony?","Yes, I do."
"You also testified and I'm referring to the question that begins at page 89, line 23, and the answer that concludes on page 90, line 9, that it's hard to personify Philip Morris, but there were scientists within R&D there were some scientists who had an opinion that smoking was addictive. Do you remember that testimony?",That's correct.
"And Mr. Cabaniss asked you -- and I'm referring to page 90, line 10 through 13 who those scientists were. And you told him you would have to look through documents to answer his question. Is that correct?",That's correct.
Was there a particular document you were referring to that you would need to look at?,"So when I answered that question, I was thinking specifically about the document written by Dr. Dunn, called ""Motives and Incentives in Smoking."""
"And have you gone back and reviewed that document, Dr. Sarkar?","Yes, I did. And I must admit that I read through that document and realized that I was actually mistaken and I had misquoted. There was no debate about or opinion about the addiction potential of cigarettes. It was actually just a summary of a conference that Dr. Dunn had attended, a scientific conference on the reasons why people smoke."
Based on your review of that,
"Dr. Sarkar, you mentioned that the document you reviewed summarized or described a conference that Mr. Dunn attended. Are you able to tell who attended that conference?","Yes, it seemed to be a scientific conference, including a number of opinion leaders in the space and they were from various disciplines, pharmacologists, psychologists, et cetera, pondering the question of why do people smoke."
Was there a book published as a result of that conference?,"Yes. Not only that, but subsequently there was a newspaper interview and an article on it. And then thereafter Dr. Dunn published a book that's still available on Amazon dot-com. You can buy it right now."
"Having looked at or, well, strike that. During the work that you've done in preparing to give your opinions as an expert witness in this case and to prepare to testify today, have you seen any documents in which scientists at Philip Morris USA stated that they believed smoking was addictive prior to 1994?","No, I have not. And even with reference to this particular document that I had in mind, I thought I had interpreted it that way, but in fact there was no mention of the word ""addiction"" in that document at all."
"Dr. Sarkar, you were asked some questions earlier in the deposition about when Marlboro Reds were introduced and when Marlboro Lights were introduced. Do you remember those questions?","Yes, I do."
Have you done any follow-up on that issue since your first session of your deposition in this case?,"Yes, I did."
And what did you determine?,"Well, I went back and reviewed and found out that Marlboro full flavor was introduced in 1954. And the specific day for Marlboro Lights was 1971. So I wasn't making an accurate representation when I was giving that information during my previous deposition."
"You were also asked earlier in the deposition about Helmut Wakeham, George Weissman, Myron Johnston, Hugh Cullman, Joe Cullman, and William Dunn. Do you remember those questions?","Yes, I do."
Are any of those individuals employed by Philip Morris today?,"No, they are not."
Are any of them employed by your employer Altria Client Services?,Right now they are way back in the past. No.
"To the best of your knowledge, have any of those individuals been employed by Philip Morris USA or Altria Client Services since 2002, when you joined Philip Morris USA?","No. I think, to the best of my knowledge, they were not employees of either of those entities."
You were also asked about the Tobacco Institute and the Tobacco Research Council. Do either of those entities exist today?,No. They have been disbanded since 1998 with the settlement agreement.
"Dr. Sarkar, you said that you had reviewed documents, Philip Morris documents, that predated the time that you joined the company in 2002. Correct?",Yes.
Can you give me an idea of how many such documents concerning the subject of addiction or nicotine dependence that you reviewed?,"I'm not sure that I can give you any specific idea. But the documents you know, in my normal course of work, I review documents and I've reviewed many documents."
"Well, you've been able this morning to recall this specific document by Dr. Dunn; correct?",Yes.
"Following the last session of your deposition, did you, on your own, decide that you should go back and review any Philip Morris documents concerning the effect of nicotine on smokers of Philip Morris products?","As I said, when I answered that specific question about opinions and the scientists on the addiction potential of nicotine, I was thinking of this specific document, which is why I went back and looked at it. As I said, I misquoted. It was not necessarily an opinion about the addiction potential. And to the best of my knowledge, I haven't come across any documents that discuss the debate of the addiction potential of nicotine and cigarettes."
So you yourself decided that you would go and look at this particular document? No one else suggested that you should review that document; correct?,"Right, because that's the document that I had in mind when I made the statements, so I thought I wanted to go back and look 0 at it."
"Now, these questions had been couched in the terms of addiction; correct?",Which questions are you talking about? Sorry.
"The questions that Mr. Snapp started out this whole conversation on and every question, I think, that's been asked thereafter has referred to the term ""addiction,"" has it not?",I think that I was responding to the questions that were asked during the previous deposition.
"Well, let me ask you this question, sir: Are you aware of any other Philip Morris documents that discuss the effects of nicotine on human beings?","Well, the document that we were talking about was one of the documents that I could think where Dr. Dunn was summarizing the proceedings from a scientific conference about the effects of nicotine."
"Well, what term did he use when describing the effect of nicotine on human beings? What term or phrase did Dr. Dunn use in this document?","You know, I would have to have the document in front of me. So generally, as I described to you earlier, he was summarizing the discussions that the scientists at this conference were having on this, you know, motives of why people smoke. So it was a pretty exhaustive document."
"Well, Dr. Sarkar, with all due respect, you said that this was a document that you had been thinking about when you answered my questions concerning internal documents at Philip Morris that referred to addiction, and that you went back and you reviewed this document. What language in that document did Dr. Dunn use concerning the effect of nicotine on human beings?","Well, I can certainly tell you that he did not use the term ""addiction"" in that regard. I was mistaken and I misquoted when they were summarizing the effects of, you know, why do people smoke. They were describing a number of factors and one of the factors they described was nicotine."
Did they discuss to what extent nicotine played a part in smokers continuing to smoke?,"You know, it's difficult to answer that specific question without having the document in front of me."
Why didn't you bring the document this morning,
since you were going to talk about it?,I didn't.
You didn't what?,I did not bring the document.
"That wasn't my question. I asked you, since you were going to talk about that particular document this morning at your deposition, why did you not bring that specific document with you so that you could answer questions about it?",I just did not. I didn't think about it.
"Do you agree, sir, that smoke is beyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine, and that the cigarette is the most optimized dispenser of smoke?",N o .
And why do you not agree with that?,"Well, the way I look at cigarette smoke, it provides the consumer with taste and a flavor experience that people enjoy. And we even redesigned it to provide the consumers with the optimum taste experience."
"So are you suggesting, Dr. Sarkar, based upon all of your experience, all of the Philip Morris documents that you have written, all of the scientific studies that have been conducted outside of Philip Morris, that the taste of the cigarette is more important than the delivery of nicotine to the smoker?","Well, I can tell you that based on my experience and everything that I have seen and done in the company, we strive to develop a product that consumers enjoy, and taste is the primary driver of taste and flavor is the primary driver that plays a role in our designing of the cigarette."
"That wasn't my question, sir. My question is are you saying, based upon your review of all of Philip Morris's internal documents, in your review of outside scientific research, that the taste of a cigarette is more important to the smoker of the cigarette than the delivery of nicotine?","Yes. When we design our cigarettes, we do consumer research to develop an, you know, optimum cigarette. Taste and flavor is the primary component that we pay attention to to meet the sensorial experience of the smoker."
"It's your testimony as you sit there under oath, Dr. Sarkar, that Philip Morris, over all the years, has paid more attention to the taste of the cigarette than the delivery of tar and nicotine from a cigarette? Is that your testimony?","What I'm saying is that when we are designing our cigarettes, we pay attention to the taste and sensorial experience of our cigarettes. We don't design our cigarettes to deliver nicotine."
"You don't design your cigarettes to what? I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.",We design our cigarettes to deliver the optimum taste and flavor sensorial experience.
"Well, I understand that that is one of the factors that you take into consideration when you design a cigarette. But that's not my question. My question is, is it your testimony that the flavor and sensorial effects of a cigarette are of greater importance than the delivery of nicotine?",And what I'm saying is that is the primary and only important thing that we consider when we are designing our cigarettes.
"Please define the word ""sensorial"" for me.","It's the experience that a smoker has when they take when they smoke a cigarette. It's the mouth feel and just the, you know, the total sensorial experience that the smoker feels when they smoke a cigarette."
"Well, now, Dr. Sarkar, there's more to it than just mouth feel, is there not?",I'm not sure what you're referring to.
You've just told me that what you take into account when it comes to sensorial effects on a human being smoking your cigarette is how the smoke feels in the mouth of the smoker; correct?,Yes.
"Is it your testimony, sir, having reviewed a bunch of Philip Morris internal documents over the years and having reviewed outside research documents over the years that there is no more to the sensorial effects on a human being from smoking than how that smoke feels to the person's mouth?","I don't think that's what I was saying. I am saying when we're designing the cigarettes, the primary factor that we consider in our design of cigarettes is the taste and the sensorial experience that the smoker gets when they're smoking our cigarette."
"So you're not concerned then, sir, with the tar and nicotine ratio in the cigarette; correct?","Well, once again, you know, it's hard to pinpoint there's a large segment of smokers. Different smokers have different taste and sensory preferences. And the tar and nicotine, they fall within that. So when we are designing, we're trying to meet the expectations of the consumers around the taste and sensory experience, and the tar and nicotine can fall variably where it may be."
"And you are also, sir, designing your cigarette by a variety of means for that cigarette to produce a certain amount of tar to the smoker and a certain amount of nicotine to the smoker, are you not?","No. No. See, when we are designing these cigarettes, there are a range of different types of sensory experiences that different consumers might have. And we have a range of different products that we have on the market. And we design the cigarettes to meet those sensory experiences of the different smokers. So, you know, of course, when you are combusting cigarettes, tar and nicotine comes in the cigarette and it can fall wherever it may be. But the primary goal is to satisfy the sensory expectations of the consumer. 4 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"You just said there's a range of different types of sensory effects experienced by the smoker. What all goes into that range, sir?",I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question.
"Yes, sir. You just said that smokers have different ranges of different types of sensory experiences they perceive from smoking a cigarette. I wanted to know everything in that range of sensory experience that smokers sense.","Let me correct myself. I don't think I said experiences. I said expectations. So we make cigarettes that are full flavored cigarettes and we make cigarettes that are, you know, light cigarettes. Of course, we don't have those descriptors anymore, as we discussed earlier. But different consumers prefer different types of products. And we make a range of products that meet those sensory expectations."
And what I want to know is what are all of the different sensory expectations that a smoker of your products would expect?,"So just going back to the work that we had been doing in this space of incorporating technologies for general exposure reduction, over the years we have had different products with different levels of inclusions of the different technologies, like ventilation holes, porous paper, expanded tobacco, et cetera. And that has resulted in a range of different cigarettes. And people have kind of developed sensory expectations around those different ranges of products that we have. So we have somebody who likes to smoke a full flavor cigarette and we have others who would like to smoke the smoke experience that comes out of, say, an ultra-light or a light cigarette. So that kind of broadly describes the type of sensory expectations that people are used to getting from the cigarette, and that's what I meant. We have a range of products for consumer to choose from and they make the choice to use one cigarette over the other."
"Well, Dr. Sarkar, you just talked about all the general reduction efforts that have been made over the years, which has resulted in the design of cigarettes that are different from full flavored cigarettes; right?",C o r r e c t .
"You would agree, would you not, sir, that when it comes to what a smoker expects from a cigarette, that the effects of the nicotine a smoker gets from a cigarette plays an important part with respect to whether or not a smoker might like a full flavored cigarette or a light, lower tar and nicotine cigarette; true?","The way I would characterize that, smokers smoke cigarettes for a number of reasons. Nicotine may be one of the reasons. I can't tell you. But I can definitely tell you when a smoker smokes cigarettes, they have certain expectations. When we design our cigarettes, we make sure that we meet the taste and sensorial expectations. Smoking is a very complex behavior."
"Well, let's get down to it. Tell me all the reasons that smokers of your variety of products choose one over the other? You talked about taste. Let's move beyond that.","You know, in general terms, there are many factors that play a role in why a smoker smokes a cigarette. As I told you, we believe and we design our cigarettes to meet their taste and sensorial expectations. And there's been research done on this. A smoker may smoke because they like the social aspect of congregating with other smokers. They may like a certain brand, a certain flavor, a certain mouth feel. Some smokers just like the notion of the hand-to-mouth motion, the smoke coming out from their mouth. As I said, the whole smoking behavior is a complex phenomenon. And we focus our efforts in designing the cigarettes to meet the taste and sensorial expectations of the smokers."
"And based upon your review of the internal documents of Philip Morris both before and after you joined the company, has that held true, that those things that you just described are what the company has and still is focusing on when it comes to the effects of smoking one of Philip Morris's products?","Everything that I've seen, and particularly my experience since 2002 I've worked closely in cigarette design and I've been involved in designing cigarettes where we've tried to reduce exposure by incorporating carbon that has been the primary focus when we design cigarettes, we make sure that you know, when we do consumer panels studies, we ensure that we meet the taste and the liking of the consumers and satisfy their expectations of the sensorial experiences."
"Well, the sensorial experience includes the effect of nicotine that the smoker gets from that cigarette on that smoker's brain, does it not?","We can sit here and talk about the variety of sensorial experiences that a smoker may experience. But when we design our cigarettes we are talking about how we design our cigarettes. We develop, you know, the components of the cigarette, the ventilation holes, the blend, et cetera, to satisfy that feel and what the smoker feels with that sensorial experience, the taste and sensorial experience that they get from smoking the cigarette. 3 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"Dr. Sarkar, that hasn't always been true, has it?",
"Cigarettes have been designed by Philip Morris to produce a particular amount of nicotine to the smoker of its cigarettes, is that not true?","No, that is not true."
"All right. Explain for me, please, why then that for a particular brand of cigarettes let's just choose Marlboro Lights there is a particular level of nicotine that the smoker gets from smoking that cigarette, and it doesn't matter if you buy the cigarettes in New York City, Los Angeles, it doesn't matter, assuming no changes in the cigarettes, if there is a span of years between the times they were manufactured. Explain that, please.","Well, you have to realize that cigarette, by definition, consists of tobacco wrapped in paper with a filter on it, in the simplest form, and tobacco has nicotine in it. When we designed our cigarettes, we make sure that we make the highest quality cigarette that consistently delivers a taste and sensory experience. So because there is nicotine in the tobacco, you do get nicotine from it. But when we design, we pay attention to the taste and sensory experience."
"And Philip Morris has, has it not, sir, also paid attention to the amount of nicotine delivered to the smoker? True?","No, sir."
You are sitting there under oath telling me that Philip Morris has not conducted research in developing its cigarettes to arrive at a certain level of nicotine that a particular brand of cigarette delivers to the smoker? Is that your testimony?,
"Well, I'm sorry that you lost track because I was about to ask you what my question was. Dr. Sarkar, you keep using the words sensorial effects and the taste of the cigarette. I am simply asking you to agree that Philip Morris, in designing its cigarettes, has conducted research and designed its cigarettes to take into account a very important consideration, and that is the tar and nicotine delivered by those cigarettes. Now, is that not true?","No. As I said earlier, when we design our cigarettes, we pay great attention to make sure that we meet the taste and sensory expectations. And the tar and nicotine falls wherever it falls within that range of whatever the cigarettes happen to have, because, you know, that's part of the tobacco, that is part of the cigarette."
"So it's your testimony that back when Philip Morris in the early '70s, late '60s, whenever it was first began to work on the concept of a so-called light cigarette, that it did not place importance on the amount of tar and nicotine it delivered to the smoker for reasons other than the taste of the cigarette or the feel of the cigarette to the smoker's mouth?",
Is that your testimony?,"No, that's not what I said. What I'm saying is that in those early days when we were looking at general exposure reduction, the target was to cause general exposure reduction and lowering the levels of tar. And that's what we ended up lowering over the years as we incorporated the different technologies. So, yes, the lowering of tar was the target in those days and ages."
"I didn't hear the word ""nicotine"" used in your answer. You also ""you"" being Philip Morris before you were there looked at the amount of nicotine that was delivered when you were trying to reduce tar, did you not?","So in our efforts to accomplish this general exposure reduction concept, you realize that we were trying to reduce the exposure to a number of constituents, tar being the primary component. And since nicotine and tar track together, yes, of course, nicotine is also going to go down, along with all the other constituents. That was the goal, to reduce the harm from cigarettes. And since we still don't know what the specific constituent that causes the harm was, we were trying to reduce general exposure to all the constituents, including tar and nicotine."
"Dr. Sarkar, you are a part of the research and development department, as I understand it?","Yes. Generally speaking, yes."
In what particular department or group are you in?,"I am in a group called Regulatory Affairs, where we deal with FDA related matters."
And is that called a group or department? Or what term does Philip Morris use?,Department.
I'm sorry?,"We don't call it department or group. It's just generally a regulatory affairs group, I guess."
"Do you have a behavioral consumer behavioral group in your Research and Development department of Philip Morris? No. In R&D? Yes, sir. No. Based upon your review of the documents, as an expert on behalf of Philip Morris, did you learn whether or not Philip Morris ever had a behavioral consumer behavioral department in the Research and Development department?","I'm just trying to recall. I don't recall seeing that, but it doesn't mean that there wasn't. I don't recall seeing it. A Q A Q"
"All right. Sir, now if I could ask you if you could either speak louder or sit a little closer to the microphone. You kind of fade out at times on me. I would appreciate it.",Certainly. I'm getting closer to the microphone.
Okay. Thank you. Do you know whether or not Philip Morris USA ever had in its Research and Development department a director of research?,Yes.
Who is currently director of research?,We currently don't have that specific title in R&D at the moment.
Do you have a similar title?,"I'm trying to think. Because R&D has got by the nature of the work, Research and Development, there are many directors in that department. So I am afraid I can't answer that question specifically."
Do you have somebody that's in charge of analytical research?,Yes.
Do you have somebody that's in Page 241 l charge of chemical research?,"I don't know what you're referring to. No, there is nobody with that title of chemical research, no, not that I know of."
How about in charge of biochemical research?,That title does not exist within the current framework.
"Okay. This paper by Dr. Dunn, that would have been delivered, as you described, sometime in 1981, would it not?","No, I don't think I described the year, so I don't recollect the specific year."
"Well, can you give me at least a reasonable range of years in which Dr. Dunn delivered that?",No. I don't know.
Do you know whether or not Philip Morris ever had under its research department a behavioral research group?,I'm just trying to recall. I don't recollect. It doesn't mean that it was not there.
"Well, assuming that it was there and assuming it was there during the latter part of the 1970s and early part of the 1980s, based upon your review of internal Philip Morris documents, do you know what type of behavioral research such a group would have been doing?","You know, I am afraid I can't answer that question. As I said, I don't recall seeing that. It doesn't mean that it may have been there, but I don't want to speculate."
So you don't know?,Yes.
"Are you familiar with the name, sir, Carolyn Levy, spelled L-e-v-y?","I don't recollect that name, no."
"I'm curious, Dr. Sarkar, this document ""Motives that you ""Motives title of document. numbered Page 243 l that Dr. Dunn authored, was it titled, and Incentives in Cigarette Smoking""?",
"Yes, certainly. Was the document reviewed, authored by Dr. Dunn, entitled, and Incentives in Cigarette Smoking""?","Yes, that was the title of the"
"Now, is it true that Dr. Dunn, on page two of the document, stated, and I quote, (as read) ""You've heard many explanations for cigarette smoking. These were reviewed at the same marketing conference. I think it appropriate that we list the One, for more commonly proposed explanations here. social acceptance or ego enhancement; two, for pleasure of the senses (taste, smell); three, for oral grat ification in the psychoanalytic sense; four, a psychomotor habit for the release of body tension; and five, for the pharmacological effect of smoke constituents, end quote.",
"Now I'm not going to ask you, sir, to interpret what Dr. Dunn meant when he said, quote, the pharmacological effect of smoke constituents. I'm simply going to ask you what do those words mean to you?","First of all, it's hard to understand the context of what that quotation is about, so it's difficult for me to provide you my analysis without having the full document in front of me ."
"Well, that's why I phrased the question the way I did. I'm not asking you, sir, to tell us what Dr. Dunn meant by the phrase, ""For the pharmacological effects of smoke constituents."" I'm simply asking you what that phrase would mean to you if you wrote that phrase?","If you're asking me to provide my assessment of that phrase, you know, in the context of what that conference was about, I think it's about, you know, scientists who were gathered to understand the different reasons why people smoke. And perhaps it was just a summary of what the opinion was among the scientists on the motives and incentives for smoking."
"What does the word ""pharmacological"" mean, sir?","If you're asking me to give you the definition of ""pharmacological,"" it's the effect on the body. Generally speaking, that's how the term would be defined."
What are the effects on the body of cigarette smoking?,"Well, that's a rather broad question, but let me try to answer it as best as I can. Seeing that the pharmacological effects on the body can be very subjective in how different people react to different in different ways to cigarette smoking. We talked about the taste and sensory aspect. You know, some people get, you know, pleasurable effect from the taste and sensory effect. So that would be one way of characterizing it."
"Do you recall, sir, reading in Dr. Dunn's document that there is strong evidence for the proposition that nicotine is the active constituent of cigarette smoke, which is the primary incentive for people to smoke?","Once again, it was a voluminous document, so I don't recall the specifics of that document."
"Well, sir, let me ask you about what Dr. Dunn wrote with respect to what the strong evidence was. (As read) ""Number one, no one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine."" Do you agree with that?",I'm sorry. Are you asking me to give my opinion whether or not I agree with that statement or whether that's what he wrote in the document?
"Well, you don't have that document in front of you. And I would suggest to you that on page four, numbered page four of his paper that he wrote, he cited strong evidence that the that nicotine was the active constituent of cigarette smoke, which was the primary incentive for people to smoke, with all other incentives being secondary. And one of the things he cited as the strong evidence was that no one had ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without n i c o t i n e . Do you agree, sir, that no one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine?","I am a scientist and I base my opinion on data and evidence. I've not seen any evidence to that effect, so I wouldn't agree with that."
You would not agree with that?,I haven't seen any evidence.
"Well, would evidence be that Philip Morris introduced a denicotinized cigarette that had very little nicotine in it into the marketplace and that that cigarette failed miserably and had to be taken off the market?","Right. But it actually reinforces the statement that I made earlier. That the denicotinized cigarette was, you know, horribly tasting. And the taste plays as we discussed earlier, plays an important role in the consumer expectations. It didn't meet their expectations. That's why there was no consumer acceptability and didn't succeed."
So it's your testimony as you sit here today under oath that the reason the denicotinized cigarette wasn't successful was that the taste wasn't good and that it had nothing to do with a smoker's expectation,
of the effect of that nicotine he expected to get on his or her body? Is that your testimony?,"Yes. Because that's what I've seen and that's what I believe, that in the process of denicotinizing, we were extracting a lot of the flavor components of tobacco. And we ended up making a cigarette that just didn't have the same flavor and taste feel that a regular cigarette had, which is why consumers just didn't like the taste of it."
"Do you, sir, agree with another piece of strong evidence Dr. Dunn cited, that most of the physiological responses to inhaled smoke have been shown to be nicotine related? Page 249 l",I'm not sure what specific strong evidence that Dr. Dunn was talking about.
"Well, I'm not asking you to go into Dr. Dunn's mind. I'm asking you whether or not you agree that most of the physiological responses to inhaled smoke have been shown to be nicotine related?","Well, so as a scientist, once again, I can tell you that cigarette smoke has got 7,000-plus constituents and it's very complicated to assign a specific response to a specific constituent. Having said that, nicotine does have a response and could be one of the constituents. But there are other constituents in fact, even as we speak, FDA has funded a research program to investigate the role of different alkaloids on the, you know, the responses in smokers."
What's an alkaloid?,Tobacco is a plant and most plants have alkaloids in them. And there are different constituents in tobacco. That's what I'm referring to as an alkaloid.
"In the manufacturing process, does Philip Morris or has Philip Morris ever used alkaloids in the manufacturing process of the cigarettes?","Specific, you know, adding alkaloids, I don't recall that we've added any alkaloids. It's just a general class of phytochemicals, chemicals from plants that are produced. I don't recall seeing anything where we have added alkaloids into our cigarettes, other than the ones that are naturally present in tobacco leaves."
Do different tobacco plants have different levels of alkaloids in them?,"Yes. Depending on the reason they're grown. Not only that, but the weather conditions can have an impact on the different levels of alkaloids."
"Is there or are there, I should say, different types of tobacco that have different levels of alkaloids?",Yes.
Would you please tell me what those different types of tobacco are and at the same time start out with the one that has the highest level of alkaloids?,"I'm going to describe to you the different types of tobacco that we use to blend into cigarettes. The typical blended cigarette has, you know, burley, oriental, and flue-cured tobacco. But, generally speaking"
Well,If I may finish.
Go ahead.,"Right. So coming back to your question specifically, as I said, that the tobacco plant as a whole, you know, is similar across the different species and the different types of tobacco. So I'm not an agricultural scientist so I can't give you specifics about the different levels in tobacco plants, but they seem to have similar content. They might vary, as I said, not only the different types but the seasons. It's a plant and it responds to the different weather conditions and the soil conditions that its grown in."
"You said burley, oriental, flue cured. Which of those has the highest level of alkaloid?",I'm sorry. I can't answer that question. I don't know.
Does the curing process affect the alkaloids and/or level of nicotine in a particular cigarette blend?,"I'm trying to frame my answer so that I can give you an accurate representation. I would imagine and I don't want to speculate, but I would imagine that the curing process, the different, you know, ways in which tobacco is air cured versus heat cured would change the composition of the leaves. So I would think it would, but I don't want to speculate too far beyond my expertise in this area. 2 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"You'd agree, sir, that the cigarette should be seen not as a product but as a p a c k a g e ? Page 253 I",No.

"Do you agree, sir, that the pack can be thought of as a storage for a day's supply of nicotine?",No.
I'm sorry?,No.
I didn't hear your answer.,No.

"Do you agree, sir, that the of a cigarette pack are instantly e?","If you're asking me whether can pick up a cigarette from a pack, yeah."
So you agree they're instantly Page 254 l accessible?,Yeah.
Do you agree that a cigarette is a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine?,No.
"Do you agree, sir, that a cigarette is readily prepped for dispensing nicotine?",No.
"Do you agree, sir, that the rate of combustion of a cigarette meters the dispensing rate, setting an upper supposedly safe limit for a substance that can be toxic in large doses?",No.
"Please keep your voice up, Dr. Sarkar. Your answer was no?","Yes, sir."
"Could you move closer to the mic, please. You do agree that nicotine can be toxic in large doses, do you not?","Yes, as long as you define what you mean by large doses."
But you do agree with that general statement?,"Yes, nicotine can be toxic at very large doses."
"Would you please repeat your answer, sir. The first three or four words are very, very faint.",Okay. So nicotine can be toxic at very large doses.
"Thank you. Do you agree, sir, that dispensing nicotine is unobtrusive to most ongoing behavior? Or at least it was back when smoking cigarettes was part of the American culture; correct?",No.
"Do you agree, sir, that a puff of smoke can be thought of as the vehicle of nicotine?",No.
"Do you agree, sir, that well, you tell me. If cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs, how long does it take to reach the brain?","Cigarette smoke, when it's inhaled as we said, there are close to 7,000 constituents and depending on the chemical I can't answer that question, because cigarette smoke does not reach the brain."
"Sir, I'm not talking about cigarette smoke. I'm talking about nicotine. How long does it take for somebody that inhales a puff of cigarette smoke into their lungs to then reach and affect the brain?","Well, biologically there's a lot of variability that's observed and it can take anywhere from, you know, half a minute to a minute to I mean it really depends. It's highly variable and depends on an individual basis. Different people it will take different times for different people."
"Have you, sir, ever seen any studies where it has been determined that it takes from seven to ten seconds for nicotine to reach the brain?","All right. So, you know, technically it's very difficult to characterize whether a compound has reached the brain, as you described it. Because in order to do that, you have to have tracers and, you know, have sophisticated methods to track the location of the nicotine in the brain. So there's a general belief that it can reach the brain as the blood supply from the lung goes into the brain. And it can take anywhere from a few seconds to up to 30 seconds to a minute to two minutes to reach the brain."
"My question was have you ever seen studies, research that has concluded that nicotine hits the brain from the lungs in seven to ten seconds, ten seconds? Yes or no?","Well, I don't recollect the specific time that it takes to reach the brain."
"So you're not saying that there hasn't been studies that have determined that, in fact, smoke gone into the lungs and nicotine to the brain takes approximately ten seconds? You're just saying you don't recollect such studies; correct? Correct. I'm sorry? Yes . I'm looking for one more thing and we'll move on. Do you agree, Dr. Sarkar, that as of 1981, the invention of cigarettes was one or not one but well, one of the most awe-inspiring inventions of mankind?","Well, there have been many awe-inspiring inventions of mankind, so I think there are others that would supercede that in my mind."
"By the way, sir, whether others at Philip Morris use the term addiction or habit or smoker satisfaction or whatever term they might have used over the years, you concluded yourself when you 21 were in school over in India in I believe it was that smoking cigarettes was addictive, did you not?",
"It's true, is it not, Dr. Sarkar, that as a student in India in I think it was in the mid-'80s, you arrived at your own conclusion that cigarette smoke, due to nicotine, was addictive; correct?","I'm trying to recollect the context of what you were talking about. But generally speaking, I was talking about my education in India and that's where this came up, that smoking was addictive."
"You said that you knew that and you agreed with that, did you not?",Yes.
"All right, sir. Let's move off that subject. I want to talk to you a bit about some of the things you had to say about the FDA. You talked about, sir, that when the FDA, by virtue of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, acquired authority over cigarettes, that manufacturers were required to report the ingredients that they used in cigarettes; correct?","Yes, beyond what we were reporting to CDC since 1985."
CDC is the Center for Disease Control; correct?,Yes.
You also said that Philip Morris is required to identify any harmful or potentially harmful ingredients or compounds in its cigarettes; correct?,"No. I think what I was referring to was that FDA had, once the bill was signed into law, created a committee and that developed a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents. And in its regulatory authority, it requires manufacturers to report the levels of these constituents in its products."
So Philip Morris USA reports these harmful or potentially harmful constituents in its cigarettes; correct?,"Yes, to FDA."
"Now before the FDA obtained its regulatory authority in 2009, who was Philip Morris required to identify the harmful or potentially harmful ingredients in its cigarettes, who did they have to report that to?","Let me just correct you. So it's harmful and potentially harmful constituents, not ingredients. And these are constituents that we measure after, you know, testing the cigarettes through standardized conditions. And I believe that I said this earlier, the ingredients we were reporting to the Center for Disease Control since 1985, before FDA had the regulatory authority. I believe we were reporting the levels of constituents. They were not at that time classified the way FDA has classified them, as HPHC. I'm abbreviating harmful and potentially harmful constituents. We were reporting levels of constituents to I believe the Massachusetts Department of Health and the Texas Authority. I don't know how long that was going on, but that was one of the reporting publications that we had."
"You said that the FDA, as I understand it, came up with a different list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents. Did I understand that correctly?","I'm not sure how different it is. And I will be honest with you, I don't have that HPHC list in front of me, but it was similar to that. But the way they were classified as HPHC, that classification and the nomenclature was derive from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Page 263 I Act ."
What does HPHC stand for?,HPHC is the harmful and potentially harmful constituent list that FDA has put together.
"Now, there were other organizations that had published a harmful and potentially harmful list of constituents. True?",I'm thinking. I think so.
Are you able to think of who that was?,"Well, one body that comes to mind is the IARC. They put together a list of constituents in cigarette smoke through research that was looked at."
Who? I'm sorry. What's the full name?,"IARC, International Agency for Research on Cancer."
How long had that list been out?,"I can't recall, but the one that I remember is the Monograph 83 in 2004."
In 2004?,Yes.
Did anyone else have any list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents of tobacco smoke before 2004?,"If you're asking if there was any regulatory body, I don't recall."
"Well, how about somebody that didn't regulate Philip Morris but nevertheless published a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents from cigarette smoke? Are you aware of any such list? And if so, what organizations published it?","As I said, you know, if there was any body or regulatory body that published such a list I want to set the record straight. There may have been a list of constituents, but the terminology of HPHC was developed by the FDA and they are the ones that called these harmful and potentially harmful constituents and published that list."
Okay. I understand what the FDA does. What I'm asking is did any other organization publish a list of constituents which they believed were potentially harmful or were in fact harmful? And let's just focus right now on the subject of cancer producing.,"Well, as I said, the list of chemicals or constituents in cigarette smoke that were carcinogenic was described by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC. Other than that, I don't recollect any regulatory body publishing such a list. It could have been, but my memory fails me."
"Did IARC well, when did IARC first come out with its list of cancer-causing or potentially cancer-causing constituents of cigarette smoke?",I'm sorry. Could you repeat your question.
"Yes, sir. When did IARC am I using the right abbreviation?","Yes, you are."
When did they first come out with a list of constituents which were harmful or potentially harmful with respect to being cancer producing?,"You know, as I said, I clearly know that in the 2004, Monograph 83, they published that list. They may have developed such a list before that, but right now I don't recall specifically the date when they published and when they created that list. I'm sorry. I don't know if any other regulatory body and clearly IARC is not a regulatory body. It was a research committee that did an assessment, so they didn't have any regulatory authority. The point is FDA developed this list and that's what we have been reporting. We're required to report under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act since 2009."
"Well, based upon your review of Philip Morris documents over the years, you are not suggesting that the scientists at Philip Morris ignored the list from IARC because they did not have regulatory authority over Philip Morris, are you?","No, not at all."
"All right. Dr. Sarkar, in discussing the FDA and its authority to regulate the cigarette industry and Philip Morris, in particular, you said that if the FDA found it advisable to do so, that it had the authority to shut down a cigarette manufacturing plant of Philip Morris; correct?","Yes, that's correct."
"Now, I would assume you would agree that when it comes to the business of designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling cigarettes, that Philip Morris can make its own decisions as to whether or not to manufacture and sell those cigarettes; correct?","Yes. Yeah, we decide to go after certain but in this new regulated environment, whatever decision we make to make any changes to our cigarettes, we would have to submit the information to FDA. And depending on the nature of the change, FDA would review the scientific evidence and give us the marketing authorization. And without that, we could not make the change or sell that cigarette."
"Well, since the FDA gained regulatory authority in 2009 from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, that has not always been true, has it?",I'm sorry. Could you clarify the question. What has not been true?
"It has not been true that for new products or substantially equivalent products, that Philip Morris could not market them until it submitted scientific proof to the FDA concerning their harmfulness or potentially harmfulness?","No, that's incorrect. You know, one of the things that once the law came into order, the FDA, according to law, would require and we have submitted close to Trade Secret substantially equivalent applications on products that were considered that would be under the regulatory authority and were not grandfathered. And therefore we submitted all the evidence and we are in the process of getting them reviewed. And FDA has come up with a number of questions and we are responding to those questions to allow them to make a determination whether they have sufficient information to then decree an order of whether the product is substantially equivalent or not substantially equivalent. If the FDA were to deem our products to be not substantially equivalent, if it's already in the market, we would have to pull them or we would not be allowed to sell those products."
You said something about not being grandfathered. What did you mean by that?,"So according to the law, FDA has regulatory authority that passed since 2009, but they extended this authority to February 15, 2007. So any 16 changes that we have made to our products since are deemed to be regulated. And we would have to submit information if they're different than the ones that have been in the market before 2007. And there 20 were some products that were on the market since that are, quote-unquote, grandfathered."
"Well, it's my understanding, you correct me if I'm wrong, that after the Act came into effect, there was a period of time that cigarette manufacturers could submit substantially equivalent products and market those products. I think it was up until sometime in 2011, was it not?","I don't remember the specific year and date. But generally speaking, any product that we have on the market since 2009, I think you are partially correct, that there were some products that we could put on the market, but we had to develop the scientific evidence and submit a substantially equivalent application. And if FDA reviews it and finds that these products are not substantially equivalent to our predicate product, then we would have if they're on the market, we would have to pull them off the market, because that's FDA jurisdiction and the regulatory authority to force manufacturers to remove products from the market if they're deemed to be non-substantially equivalent."
"Well, let me ask this, Doctor. Am I generally correct that there was this grace period which extended until sometime in 2011 to be able to file an application of whatever the product was substantially equivalent and yet be able to go ahead and market that product at the same time?","I think that's generally correct, that, you know, manufacturers had the ability to put products on the market but also submit the substantial equivalent. But the important part is we had to submit the substantial equivalent application and once FDA reviewed those substantial equivalent applications and deem them to be non-substantially equivalent, then manufacturers have to pull that product from the market. And there are actually several examples where FDA has been making rulings on products and have asked have deemed some products to be non-substantially equivalent."
"Well, how many substantially equivalent well, let me ask you this question. Am I terming it right when I say filing a substantially equivalent product application? If not, what is it called?",I think that generally we can say that these are substantially equivalent applications. We call them regulatory submissions to the Agency to provide them with all the evidence for them to make a determination whether they're substantially equivalent or not.
All right. How many substantially equivalent regulatory submissions did Philip Morris submit to the FDA during this grace period so that they could go ahead and put the product out on the market?,That specific question I don't think I can answer. But I can tell you that we have submitted close to Trade substantially equivalent applications.
"But you can't give me any idea okay. You can't tell me the number that was submitted during the grace period where Philip Morris could go ahead and market those products. Can you give me a general range that were filed, submitted of the number of the Trade before the expiration of that grace period?",I am afraid I don't know that.
So I guess it would then be true you don't know how many were filed after that grace period where Philip Morris had to wait until the FDA determined that it was suitable to go ahead and market the product; correct?,"Let me try to understand the question. So are you asking how many applications did Philip Morris submit during the grace period and how many applications did we submit after the grace period? I don't know the specific number of applications that were submitted over the years, but I do know that we have submitted several applications, amounting to about Trade t h a t a r e i n different stages of review at FDA. And, once again, I'm just grossly generalizing the number to Trade I d o n ' t know t h e exact number of applications that we have submitted since the law came into enactment."
"Yes, sir. But insofar as just a rough idea, a percentage of a number that were submitted during the grace period when you would go ahead and market the product as opposed to after the grace period where you-all had to wait for FDA's approval to market the product, you can't give me any kind of a percentage estimate?","I don't want to speculate. You see, the thing is with this under this new regulatory authority, any small change that we make, we have to inform the FDA and FDA needs to make a determination whether it's accepted. Just to give you an example, if we have a vendor that is supplying certain ingredients and if that vendor changes, we have to inform the FDA even if it's exactly the same ingredient but now we are buying it from a different vendor. So pretty much anything that we do during the design phase that changes what was being done before, we have to inform the FDA and they have to review. So I don't want to speculate on percentage of, you know, products that have been submitted."
"Do you have any idea, Dr. Sarkar, from anything you've read about the approximate total number of substantially equivalent regulatory submissions that were filed by the cigarette industry before the expiration of the grace period, so that those products could be marketed and sold to the public without having to wait for an FDA approval?",I would be speculating. But I know that there are lots of applications that are under review and at different stages of review. And FDA has made decisions on many of them and reviewed them through the process and deemed them either to be substantially equivalent or non-substantially equivalent.
Has Philip Morris received any determination from the FDA that any of its substantially equivalent products which it filed a regulatory submission were approved to be marketed?,
"All right. Dr. Sarkar, the question that is now pending, I will reask again. And that is, has Philip Morris received approval on any of its substantially equivalent regulatory submissions to the FDA? Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information Redacted And we have been working closely with FDA to, you know, get them all the information that they need to make an informed decision.",
"All right, sir. Let me ask you this, has Philip Morris filed any new product regulatory submissions with the FDA?",Trade Secret Information Redacted
Do any of the substantially equivalent regulatory submissions which Philip Morris filed involve a scientifically proven reduction in the harmful or potentially harmful constituents of the cigarettes that Philip Morris is currently selling to the public?,So
"So since February 15, I think you said 2007, for those cigarettes that Philip Morris has sold to the public from then until today, August 13th, 14th, whatever it is, the Philip Morris cigarettes still have the same level of harmful and potentially harmful constituents, in particular cancer-causing constituents; correct?","Well, if you're asking me whether the substantially equivalent applications that we have submitted are similar to the product that were on the market, there is a range of substantially equivalent applications that we've submitted. And in that portfolio of products, we have varying levels of constituents no, that's not correct. There are different levels of HPHC in the products that we have submitted for substantial equivalence. And going back to the earlier comment that I made, if we make a product that has got, you know, lower levels, that would be something that we would have to work with the regulatory agency and determine the appropriate pathway, whether it's a new product or a modified risk tobacco product. And those are conversations that we are having with the Agency to make the determination as to what would be the right fit and what kind of evidence we're working closely with the FDA in making that determination."
"Well, yes, sir, I understand what you are doing. But then I would be correct that there has been no improvement in the risk exposure of Philip Morris cigarettes since February 15, 2007; right?",Trade Secret Information Redacted Trade Secret Information Redacted
"Well, Dr. Sarkar, you know, I understand you're working and I respect that, but my question is I'm talking about what is out in the marketplace. There's been no improvement, as I understand from what you are saying, with respect to the risk of exposure from harmful or potentially harmful constituent in the cigarettes that Philip Morris is currently marketing to the public; correct?","Well, it goes back to the regulatory authority of FDA. You know, even if we had products that have reduced levels of HPHC, we would not be able to just put them on the market without getting market authorization, without FDA reviewing the scientific evidence."
"Well, so the answer to my question is that I am correct, Philip Morris doesn't have anything out on the marketplace that has improved the risk exposure from harmful and potentially harmful constituents of its cigarettes? And I'm talking about what's out there for the public to buy.","So broadly speaking, if you're looking at cigarettes, you know, if there are any reduced constituent cigarettes that are on the market since 2009, no. But there are a lot of other options that, you know, Altria has been working on that are actually on the market that smokers could choose from."
"When is the last time that you could say under oath that Philip Morris was able to design, develop, manufacture, and sell a cigarette that had a lower risk of exposure to harmful or potentially harmful cancer-causing constituents?","Well, I can tell you that that was one of the main reasons I joined the company. When I joined the company, we were working and that was the project that I was personally involved in. We were looking at reducing the levels of constituents by incorporating, you know, carbon, activated carbon in the filter and those products. This was before FDA was enacted and issued this regulatory authority, we put those products on the market and test-marketed them. So, yeah, we continuously work on trying to reduce the harm from our products. That is the mission of our company."
"Well, you discussed that when you talked and you mentioned today general reduction efforts and accomplishments over the years that Philip Morris has made to its cigarettes to reduce the risk exposure; right? That's what you are, in essence, describing?","No. What I was referring to were, you know, projects that we had ongoing. We constantly have been trying to figure out new, innovative ways of lowering the risk profile of our cigarettes. And the project that I worked on in the 2000s was around using activated carbon in our filters to absorb some of the harmful constituents. Another project that we were working on was an electrically heated cigarette system that, you know I was personally involved in developing the testing and determining how we would evaluate these products, which goes back to what was the main reason why we wanted FDA regulation, was that we wanted a regulatory body to provide us with the framework so that we can develop the scientific evidence, the regulatory body can review the scientific evidence, and then we can provide clear and honest communication to the consumers about either the risk reduction or exposure reduction to these different constituents. And those are the products that we have worked on beyond just the general exposure reduction."
"Dr. Sarkar, I thank you for that answer and I appreciate it. Unfortunately, there were about three or four things that you put into that answer that cause me to spend a lot more time with you. I'm not going to discuss them all with you. You talked about the risk exposure work that you did in the 2000s; correct?",Yes.
You also spoke about communicating openly and honestly about the harmful and potentially harmful effects of your products; correct?,"What I was referring to was, you know, once again the pathways that FDA has established and the framework that it has established for, you know, a modified risk tobacco product. And if we have to communicate that there's an exposure reduction or risk reduction, those are the two pathways for modified risk tobacco products that we can then communicate to the consumer. And FDA has regulatory authority to review the scientific evidence and language that we would use to communicate to the consumers and thereby give authorization to market those products."
"Let me ask you this, sir, with respect to your work in the 2000s and your review of internal company documents, isn't it true, Dr. Sarkar, that the risk of exposure to the cancer-causing constituents of Philip Morris cigarettes are, in fact, worse than they were decades ago?",No. 3 BY MR. CABANISS:
"Well, the so-called lights that Philip Morris produced and you mentioned lights in response to your answer to Mr. Snapp about how Philip Morris I'm sorry, the FDA banned the use of descriptors such as lights and lower tar and nicotine. It's true, is it not, that Philip Morris did not remove the descriptor ""lights"" until it was required to by the Food and Drug Administration?","You know, we complied with the regulation. And when FDA required us to remove the descriptors, we did remove them."
"That wasn't my question. My question is all the way up until the time that the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was going through Congress, and during that time part of that Act was going to be that descriptors such as lights, ultra-lights, lower tar and nicotine were going to be prohibited, Philip Morris did not, of its own volition, voluntarily remove those descriptors from its packages of cigarettes, did it?","I'm not sure I understand the question. We talked about this earlier. Over the years with the research that we had done on the general exposure reduction, we had a range of products that were on the market and we used that mechanism to communicate to the consumers about the different taste profiles of the different products."
"I'm not talking about taste or I'm talking about the harmful or potentially harmful cancer-causing constituents of cigarettes, Philip Morris cigarettes in particular. There was no effort by Philip Morris when all this was being discussed, about prohibiting lights and ultra-lights and lower tar and nicotine descriptors, because of the fact that they did not reduce the exposure to risk, there was no effort by Philip Morris to go ahead and remove those descriptors until they had to?",
Right?,"So your question has several components. If you're asking me whether, you know, as a result of the general exposure reduction, there has been a reduction in exposure to the constituents, I would say absolutely. There has been a substantial body of scientific evidence that has shown consistently over and over again that the level of exposure is lower in light smokers as opposed to full flavor smokers. I have done studies, been involved in massive clinical trials with thousands of smokers and we have shown that it consistently results in lower exposure."
"So in your work, sir, with Philip Morris as a scientist and now involved with Regulatory Affairs, did you previously have involvement in this study by thousands and thousands of smokers which proved that there was a substantial lowering of the risk of exposure to cancer-causing constituents in light, ultra-light cigarettes?","As I said, we've done not only that study, but we have done other studies, and others have published in scientific literature, which have shown that there is significant reduction in exposure to constituents in the lights smokers."
"Well, I'm talking about the one where there were thousands and thousands, as you say, of participants. Did you directly participate in that study? r\ *N.-% {%.-% -' f ' ' ^ ^","If you're asking me whether I was involved in the conduct of the study and oversight, I was one of the team members. And I didn't participate in the study because, you know, we as employees don't participate in those clinical trials. This was done in the general smoking population. And what we showed was that lower yield cigarettes have lower exposure."
"Well, then I take it then, sir, that you disagree with what the Surgeon General has said over the years, beginning with the Surgeon General's report of 2004, that today's cigarettes have not reduced the risk of exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful constituents? And I'm speaking specifically about the Marlboro Light and Ultra Light cigarettes.","Well, all I can say is that I don't know what evidence the Surgeon General relies on in making that conclusion. But I can tell you based on my analysis of the scientific evidence, objectively, if you look at all the scientific publications and all the evidence, I believe that as the yield goes down, exposure goes down."
"Well, you are aware, I would assume, sir, that the Surgeon General of the United States in the 2004 report concluded that although characteristics of cigarettes have changed during the last 50 years and yields of tar and nicotine have declined substantially as assessed by the Federal Trade Commission's test protocol, the risk of lung cancer in smokers has not declined. Do you agree or disagree with that finding?","Well, once again, I mean there are a number of things that we would agree on with the Surgeon General's report. But on this one, I would say that I just look at I am a scientist. I look at the data. And all the evidence that I've reviewed points in the direction that over the years consistently has shown that reducing the yield reduces exposure. There's no doubt about that."
"Well, you don't think the Surgeon General put out the 2004 report without any scientific basis for the conclusions contained in that report, do you?","Once again, I can't debate the evidence that was used by the 2004 Surgeon General. I can also say that since 2004, when we published the results for this last clinical trial which was subsequent to the 2004 report and the research we have done ourselves added to the already existing body of evidence that proved that lower yield, lower exposure."
"Well, we'll get to that in just a moment. I just want to ask you, do you agree, sir, with the conclusion in the 2004 Surgeon General's report that adenocarcinoma has now become the most common type of lung cancer in smokers; that the basis for this shift is unclear, but it may reflect changes in the carcinogens in cigarette smoke?",I would respectfully disagree because I haven't seen any evidence to that effect. And even the Surgeon General says there's insufficient evidence to assign cigarette design to that phenomenon.
"Do you agree, sir, with the and, by the way, these are all the conclusions of the Surgeon General in 2004 with respect to cancer reported in Chapter 2, and specifically lung cancer. Do you agree that lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in men are now declining, reflecting past patterns of cigarette use, while rates in women are still rising?","I'm trying to recollect the specific language of the Surgeon General's conclusion from the 2004 report. But, generally"
"Well, assume I just read it to you verbatim, as I did with the others that I asked you about.","Once again, if I look at the evidence, that doesn't necessarily today the evidence doesn't support that. I see that there continues to be a decline in lung cancer rates."
So it's your testimony that the rate of cancer in both men and women was declining in 2004 and has continued to decline; correct?,That's what I remember. I've seen the data recently and I have no reason to believe that they're increasing.
"So with respect to all three of those conclusions of the Surgeon General made in 2004, do you disagree with those conclusions as of the time period 2004?",I respectfully would disagree.
"So you do? As of what was known at that time, you disagree with those three conclusions of the Surgeon General?","Well, once again, I'm telling you that when I look at the rates of lung cancer today, they are they continue to decline."
"Well, do you agree, sir, with the conclusions, chapter conclusions of the 2010 Surgeon General's report found at page 9, chapter two, talking about, quote, the change in cigarette that and, I quote, the evidence indicates that changing cigarette designs over the last five decades, including filter, low tar, and light variations, have not reduced overall disease risk among smokers and may have hindered prevention and cessation efforts. Do you, sir, agree or disagree with the Surgeon General's conclusions in 2010?","Well, once again, you know, I respectfully would disagree with the Surgeon General's conclusion because I, as a scientist, when I look at the evidence, there's a large body of evidence that has shown that the changes in the 8 cigarette design that have been made over the past years have led to reduction in exposure, reduction in disease rate."
"Well, sir, as a scientist and in your position in Regulatory Affairs, did you review the authority cited in the Surgeon General's report for the conclusion that I just read to you?","I've looked at the entire body of evidence, including the evidence that was included in the Surgeon General's report. I still believe there is a substantial body of evidence that would lead me to conclude that, you know, the changes in the cigarette design have led to reductions in exposure and disease risk."
So you disagree with the Surgeon General's conclusions in 2010; correct?,"I would respectfully disagree with that conclusion, because I reach a different conclusion when I look at the evidence."
"Dr. Sarkar, have you read, sir, the 2014 Surgeon General's report entitled, ""The Health Consequences of Smoking, 50 Years of Progress""?",Yes.
"Do you agree, sir, withthe overall conclusions of the Surgeon General in the I'm sorry, the 2014 Surgeon General's report?","I'm sorry. Which conclusion are you talking about? If you asked if cigarette smoking is harmful and the best way to reduce the risk is not to smoke, I would agree with that."
"Well, for example, the Surgeon General talks about goes back to the 1964 Surgeon General's report, in fact, a couple of years before that, and talks in terms of at that time there being a scientific consensus linking cigarette smoking and disease. Do you agree, sir, there was a scientific consensus, as reported in the 2014 Surgeon General's report, as of 1964?",I'm sorry. I'm confused by your question. Can you rephrase that.
I'm simply asking you a few questions about the 2014 Surgeon General's report. Have you read it?,"Yes, I have."
"And in that report the Surgeon General says that in 1964, there was a solid evidence-based foundation for appropriate remedial action by the U.S. Public Health Service responding to the emergent epidemic of lung cancer being caused by a highly profitable consumer product, the 4 cigarette. Do you agree, sir?",
"That the 1964 Surgeon General's report was based on solid evidence linking cigarette smoking and disease to the emerging epidemic of lung cancer caused by a highly profitable consumer product, the cigarette?","No, I don't agree with that characterization."
What don't you agree with?,"Well, you know that was the statement that was made in 2014 Surgeon General about, you know, the 1964 Surgeon General report being based on strong scientific evidence, I think that that was still emerging and I don't think that, you know, there was as strong evidence even the Surgeon General in 1964 said it was limited to men and the evidence was not as strong."
So you disagree with what the Surgeon General said to that respect in the 196 or the 2014 Surgeon General report?,Yes.
"Do you recall what the Surgeon General had to say in terms of the portion of the 2014 Surgeon General's report in Chapter 6 on cancer, concerning the change in cigarette and risk for lung cancer over time? Did you read that section?","Yes, I did."
Do you recall what the Surgeon General concluded? And I'm obviously trying to ask this in general as opposed to going through everything that's said. Do you recall what the Surgeon General concluded in 2014 with respect to whether or not the changing design of cigarette over time improved the risk of cancer from smoking?,"Of course, I don't have the specific conclusions in front of me, but I have some general recollections."
And what's your general recollection in that regard?,As you described it.
"I'm sorry. I didn't hear you, Doctor?",Just as you described it earlier.
"All right. And you disagree with that, based on your own review of scientific research and studies; correct?","Specific around that point, I would draw a different conclusion based on my review of the science."
"Do you agree with the Surgeon General's conclusions in the 2014 Surgeon General's report, Chapter 2, page 34?","When I said I read the Surgeon General's report, I read it but I don't remember the specific quotes on the specific page. If you can just refresh my memory."
"Yeah, I'm going to, Doctor. Do you agree or disagree that the complexity of smoking, the addicting nature of nicotine, and the dynamic efforts of the industry to maintain its markets challenge the initial efforts to curve tobacco use?","I would respectfully disagree, because I haven't seen any evidence towards that."
"Do you agree or disagree with the conclusions on that same page, looking back over the entire 50 years, since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, that several factors were particularly crucial in altering social norms around cigarette smoking in the United States, making it increasingly less acceptable. One, the emergence of a nonsmoker's rights movement and evidence linking exposure to secondhand smoke to disease. Do you agree with the number one 9 factor cited by the Surgeon General in the Surgeon General's report?",I haven't seen any evidence that would lead me to agree to that statement.
"The second crucial factor cited by the Surgeon General in the 2014 Surgeon General's report, for smoking over the years becoming less acceptable, was stated as an understanding of regular cigarette smoking as an addictive behavior and one that begins in adolescence. Do you agree, sir, that that was a crucial factor that occurred over the 50 years, between 1964 and 2014?","Could you repeat that, please, for me."
"Yes, sir. The Surgeon General stated in 2014 in the Surgeon General's report that several factors were particularly crucial in altering social norms around cigarette smoking in the United States, making it increasingly less acceptable. I've already asked you and you said you disagree with number one, the emergence of non-smoker's rights movements and evidence linking exposure to secondhand smoke and disease. I'm asking you about the second crucial factor making smoking less acceptable, and that being an understanding of regular cigarette smoking as an addictive behavior and one that begins in adolescence?",
Do you agree or disagree with that factor?,"Once again, I haven't seen any evidence that would lead me to draw that conclusion."
"And the third crucial factor cited by the 2014 Surgeon General concerning the smoking of cigarettes becoming increasingly less acceptable was, and I quote, a focus on the tobacco industry itself as a key influence on smoking behavior and the importance of countering its actions. Do you agree or disagree with that statement by the 2014 Surgeon General?","I would say the same to this as well, because I haven't seen any evidence that would lead me to believe that's the case. I wouldn't draw that conclusion."
"Do you agree with the Surgeon General's statement concerning 50 years of progress since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, that despite conclusive evidence of the harms of cigarette smoking present in the 1964 report and evaluated by an objective group of experts, the process of changing, quote, public beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors took decades. And the implementation of effective policies involved a lengthy process of intervention, evaluation, and surveillance. Do you agree or disagree with that statement?","You know, this is something that I can't comment agree or disagree, because I'm not familiar with this concept, with this phenomenon. It's outside my scope of expertise."
"Well, the 2014 Surgeon General continued and please tell me if you agree or disagree with this statement. The tobacco industry's extensive campaign to counteract these forces through marketing, public relations, political influence, and creation of doubt about the scientific evidence on tobacco is now well documented through the industry's internal records. The industry used its influence to thwart public health action at all levels and fraudulently misled the public on many issues, including whether lower yield cigarettes conveyed less risk to health and whether exposure through secondhand smoke harmed non-smokers. Undoubtedly, these actions slowed progress in tobacco control. Do you agree or disagree, sir?",
"Do you agree, sir, or disagree?",
As an employee of Philip Morris and as Philip Morris's listed expert witness?,"Well, I would say that with everything I've seen and experienced in the company, I would respectfully disagree with those conclusions."
All right. You have on several occasions mentioned how studies and I believe you said published studies of Philip Morris researchers and scientists showed that lowering the yield of tar and nicotine in products provided actual smokers with a lower risk of exposure to harmful constituents of tobacco smoke. Correct?,That's correct.
"And in talking about the studies published by Philip Morris, the one involving thousands of participants was published in the Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology Journal; correct?",That was one of the journals that we published in. We published in numerous other scientific publications and also there are publications by other scientists as well that have consistently shown that lower yields results in lower exposure.
"Well, let's focus on this particular study that involved thousands of participants. All right, sir?",Okay.
"Now, as I understand it, that actual study occurred in I believe 2003, did it not?","In that general time frame. I think it was a long, drawn-out study because it took us a while to recruit these participants. I think it lasted from 2002 to 2003, if I'm not mistaken."
"Okay. In any event, in the published article by Paul is it Mendes, M-e-n-d-e-s?",Correct.
Sunil Kapur; is that correct?,Sound right.
"I'm going to butcher this first name of this nex A Q A Q Roethig, R-o-e-t A Q yours ? A Q of this particul it was published Pharmacology, introduction on made, (as read) exposure to smok Page 304 l t person. Jingzhu Wang? That's correct. Shixia Feng; is that correct? Yes. And Hans I don't know if it's - h - i - g ? That's correct. I assume they were colleagues of Yes, that's correct. Now, I notice in the introduction ar article that was published and in 2008 at Regulatory Toxicology and , 2008, pages 295 through 305, in the the first page, the statement is ""For accurate determination of human e constituents, it's necessary to conduct well designed clinical studies."" A Q by other people were looking at cigarettes with in some of these Do you agree with that statement? Yes. In looking at other studies done at other points in times, where they the exposure levels in smokers of different tar yields, they note that studies, smokers were forced to switch from their usual brands to higher or lower tar yields while the cross-sectional studies compared exposure in smokers smoking different tar yield cigarettes as their regular brand. Now, what's the significance, sir, of forced switching",
in a well designed clinical study?,
"And now I forget where I was. I had asked you, sir, in your clinical study standpoint, what significance forcing participants to switch from their usual brands to higher or lower tar yield cigarettes would make to the study?","Sure. You know, that's a pretty involved answer. I can sit here and walk you through the different types of clinical study designs and we could be here for several days. I teach a course at the university on this topic. But let me try and summarize as briefly as I can on some of the strengths and limitations of the different types of clinical trial study designs. You know, when you're trying to directly assess the changes in exposure when smokers switch from one cigarette to another, one way would be to look at cross-sectional designs, as my colleagues rightfully pointed out, where you look at the levels of exposure in smokers that are smoking those brands as their regular cigarettes. Another way to do that would be to bring in participants and switch them to the lower yield cigarettes and then monitor the exposure. That does not mean that one is better than the other. But on the contrary, what we found was that we found consistent results regardless of however you look at it, whether you do it as a switching study or as a cross-sectional study."
"Okay. Let me ask you this question, sir. As I understand it, from having read this publication about this study several times so I could try to understand it, you basically or they basically were trying to examine the question of whether smokers who switched to Marlboro Light cigarettes from Marlboro Full Flavor cigarettes experienced a reduction in smoke exposure due to the brand of cigarettes they smoked. That's basically what was trying to be accomplished; correct?",Yes.
And I believe they used cigarettes that were produced in 2003; correct?,Yes.
"Now the study well, let me ask you this question since you teach courses in this. When it comes to studies, what does ""randomized"" mean?","A randomized clinical trial is, you know, a mechanism by which we can minimize a potential confounder. So, you know, when you are trying to study the effect of switching, you want to make sure that there is a reasonable distribution of the steady population between the two groups, in other words, there is equal number of men and women, they are smoking similar numbers of cigarettes, and trying to minimize any other factors that could account for the differences. So we are making an apple-to-apple comparison."
"Okay. Thank you. As I understand it and I now understand randomized. As I understand it, this study randomized smokers of Marlboro Full Flavor into different groups, two of which were groups that continued to smoke Marlboro Full Flavor and the third group being one that was switched to Marlboro Lights; correct?","Right. I'm trying to recollect the study design. I don't have the paper in front of me, so I don't remember the specifics of the study design. But I think there was one other group that switched to Marlboro Ultra-Lights. I could be wrong, but I think so. There were three groups."
"Well, in any event, one of these groups, as I read the study, was switched from Marlboro Full Flavor to Marlboro Full Flavor. And that was necessary because studies which require a smoker to switch cigarettes as part of the study commonly find a reduction in the amount of smoking following the switch. True?","Yes. Say that again. I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. Could you repeat your question."
"Yes, sir. There is a need, as reported in this study, for a comparison group of smokers who were supposedly switched from Marlboro Full Flavor to Marlboro Full Flavor, because studies show that requiring a smoker to switch cigarettes as part of a study that's called forced switching studies commonly find a reduction in the amount a of smoking following the switch. True?","No, that's not true. The reason why we always have this control group is that we want to make sure first of all, going back to the question that you asked about randomization, we make sure that the distribution of the study participants in the different groups are even, so we have an even number of males and females, an even number of cigarettes smoked, et cetera. And just the fact that they're in a clinical study environment, we like to have a control group to make sure that that kind of captures the effect of being in the study. I don't think that it's been shown one way or the other. It could go up or down, different things can happen, and that's why you want to have this control group, to account for this phenomenon. 4 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"Right. And you were looking at as we discussed starting out, the design of the study was to attempt to determine human exposure to constituents, tar, if you will, when people are switched from a full flavor cigarette to a lower yield tar and nicotine cigarette, so-called light cigarette; right?",Correct.
That was the purpose of the study?,Correct.
"Okay. Now, you have to make sure, as you've said, that you're comparing apples to apples. And the authors, the people who did this study, as we've already discussed, pointed out that there were studies out there where smokers were forced to switch from their usual brand to higher or lower yield cigarettes as compared to cross-sectional studies. You don't want the fact that they are forced to switched to influence the result of the study; correct?",Certainly.
I'm sorry?,Certainly. You want to try to make sure that you have appropriate controls in the study.
"All right. So in this study, and as reported in this article, they accounted for that or tried to account for that by forcing some smokers who were already Marlboro Full Flavor that's the higher yield nicotine cigarette smokers. They forced them to switch to the same Marlboro Full Flavor higher yield and nicotine cigarettes so they would have the results of that control group to make sure that the results, when measuring switching smokers from Marlboro Full Flavor, higher yield tar and nicotine cigarettes, to Marlboro Lights, that the switching did not account for all or a portion of the results; correct?",Right. That was
You have to have a control group?,"That was an attempt to try to minimize the confounding effects, yes."
"Okay. Now the reason for doing that is that in studies where there is forced switching of cigarettes, there is commonly found a reduction in the amount of smoking following the switch; right? That's why you had to have a control group of folks who were regular Marlboro Full Flavor smokers, and unbeknownst to them, they were switched but really not switched to Marlboro Full Flavor regular smokers; correct?","So let me try to understand your question. If you're saying that forced switching you said reduces the cigarette consumption, I don't think that was necessarily what's been shown one way or the other. Because as I said earlier, the reason for having this control is they could reduce or increase. They could go either way. But having the control group allows you to kind of anchor your comparisons, whatever may happen in that setting."
"Now, the design of this study, which I got from reading it the second time, included a period of supervised smoking, where on the initial day, Day One, I believe it's called, the baseline to which all of the results were compared; right?","I'm sorry. Could you repeat your question. You used a term that I didn't hear clearly. Would you mind repeating the question, please."
"Certainly. I wrote it down from the report, but let me just go to the report. And I'm looking at page 296 under Short-Term Phase. It says (as read), Baseline exposure investigations were performed on Day One. And at the end of that day, then the smokers or subjects were randomized into one of three groups. Group Marlboro Full Flavor, that was a control group, continued to smoke Marlboro Full Flavor cigarettes; Group ML, which stands for Marlboro Lights, switched to Marlboro Lights cigarettes; and finally Group MUL, Marlboro Page 315 I Ultra-Lights, switched to Marlboro Ultra-Light cigarettes for eight days each. All right. So the baseline against which the results were measured or compared occurred on Day One of the study; correct?","Right. So I think I was correct initially when I told you that there was a third group which switched to Marlboro Ultra-Lights and the baseline, we typically call it Day Minus One, is assessed to get some confirmation that, you know, what was their exposure before they did the switching."
"All right, sir. And baseline exposure Day One allowed the smokers to smoke percent of the amount of cigarettes that they told the researchers was their daily maximum; correct?",Up to 12 0.
Up to 120 percent. They could smoke 20 more percent than what they self-reported to the researchers that they normally smoked; right?,Yes.
"Now, this study also, as I read it, allowed the participants, the smokers, to smoke from 7:00 o'clock in the morning to 11:00 o'clock at night. And that would be 7:00 in the morning until well, it says 2300 hours. That would be 11:00 at night; right?","That's correct. I just want to make a general comment. I think we are getting into specifics of the study protocol which I don't have in front of me, so I'm going to try to answer your question as best as I can. It would help me immensely if it were in front of me. But, bottom line, what we showed in the study, when you switch a smoker to a light cigarette, you get lower exposure."
"Well, we will get to that, Doctor, and I promise you what I am reading to you, you can go back and see if I'm not reading it verbatim. And I'm at the bottom of page 297. And the portion that I just suggested to you with respect to when these participants were allowed to smoke, is that the subjects were allowed and I'm quoting, ""The subjects were allowed to smoke up to their daily allotment of cigarettes in separate rooms designated for each study group from 0700 to 2300 at predetermined times only (every 32 minutes, based on the maximum of 30 cigarettes over 16 hours.) And they did that from Baseline to Day Eight."" Does that mean, does it not, sir, that these smokers were allowed to smoke from 7:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night, or they were allowed to smoke over the course of 16 hours? Correct?",
"Dr. Sarkar, I read to you that cigarettes were given to the participant smokers from 7:00 o'clock to 11:00 o'clock, at a predetermined 1 time only. And as a sample, they said every 2 minutes, based on a maximum of 30 cigarettes over hours. Now, how they determined that, I believe, would be that the number of hours multiplied 6 by 60 to get the number of minutes, so 16 hours by minutes would be 960 minutes to smoke. Am I correct so far?","If you are reading it from the manuscript and that's what they stated, then that should be correct."
"All right. So if you divide the total number of minutes allowed to smoke, 960, by the amount of cigarettes that was determined on Day One, Baseline Day, that each smoker smoked, if you divided 960 minutes by 30 cigarettes -- as they say they would give a smoker who smokes 30 cigarettes over the course of 960 minutes a cigarette every 32 minutes; correct?","While technically that's correct, let me explain to you how the study is set up."
Right. Right. They didn't have to; correct?,Correct.
"Insofar as the amount they could have, up to 120 percent, that was the amount they were allowed to smoke, from the amount they reported they normally smoked in a day? That was the maximum Q A Q A amount they could smoke during the Day One; correct?",Correct.
Now it was the actual amount of cigarettes they smoked during Day One that then resulted in the number of cigarettes they could smoke per day over the course of the study; correct?,"Not exactly, I think. I have to go back and look at the clinical protocol as to how did we determine the I mean, remember, you said that they were allowed to smoke up to 120 percent, so that limit stayed through the study."
"No. Okay. Let me find it. It says (as read), ""They were monitored on Day Two, Acclamation Day, to determine each subject's maximum daily allotment of cigarettes for the remainders of the short-term phase, Baseline to Day Eight. So that doesn't say anything about they could go ahead and smoke another 20 percent of cigarettes; correct?",
"Well, in any event, I want you to assume that what they say here is true, and that is that they determine on a given day the total number of cigarettes that each subject could smoke from 7:00 in the morning till 11:00 o'clock at night, and they could smoke it at predetermined times only, and 16 that's a quote. They then go on to explain every minutes, based on the maximum of 30 cigarettes over 16 hours from Baseline to Day Eight. They continue, subjects were never forced to smoke and were allowed to smoke less than their daily allotment of cigarettes, or even quit smoking at any time during this study. So the study determined how many cigarettes each smoker would get and the study took that number of cigarettes, divided it into 16 hours they were awake, for 960 minutes. And that came up with the times at which the cigarettes would be allowed to be smoked by the participants, 960 divided by 30 equals 32, every 32 minutes. Now, does that refresh your recollection?","Well, okay, if that's what it says, but I think that's one assumption. I would need to verify by looking at the clinical protocol as to how did they determine the maximum allowable cigarettes for the duration of the study. It was I think 120 percent of what they smoked at baseline, but I don't know the answer to that question specifically."
"Okay. Well, let's not waste your time debating that issue. Now, would I be correct that if a smoker smoked, let's say, two packs of cigarettes 22 when they were monitored, that would be cigarettes. And if you divide 960 minutes by 40, that would be a cigarette every 24 minutes; correct?","That would be correct. Except that if you go back and look at the specifics of the study design once again, I don't have the information in front of me. But I think that we did 6 not recruit anybody who was smoking more than cigarettes per day. If I recollect it's been a very long time since I looked at the study. But the study participants were smoking 10 to 30 cigarettes a 11 day. So I don't think anybody was smoking cigarettes a day."
"You know, I think you are right, Doctor. I think I did read that somewhere. Ten to 30 cigarettes a day smokers were recruited. Now, let me ask you this question, does that factor equal a confounding factor when it comes to the results of the study? 0 A No.",
Why not?,"Why should it be? Because remember we had controls and comparators, so we chose smokers who were smoking 10 to 30 cigarettes a day. And if you look at the average cigarette consumption, that's comparable to what an average cigarette consumption is in the smoking population. So I don't see how it would be a confounder."
"All right. Be that as it may, let's go ahead, if we could, now and get to kind of the bottom line.",
"All right. Dr. Sarkar, from a scientific standpoint, the meaningful comparison using this study design, which was used in the study resulting in this paper that we have been discussing, published by researchers at Philip Morris, would be using it to determine statistically whether there were changes observed in exposures for the smokers who were switched to Marlboro Lights as compared to those who continued smoking Marlboro Full Flavor; right?",Right.
"Now I appreciate that you don't have the paper with you, but that comparison of smokers who were switched to Marlboro Lights to smokers of full flavor Marlboros who were switched to remained on full flavor Marlboros was made in the paper in Table 3-A. Are you able to recall that table?",No.
What does it mean for something to be statistically significant?,"As the word represents, you do a statistical test and it shows that it's statistically significant."
"Well, doesn't that involve some probability percentage to a particular level of competence?",I'm not sure I understand your question. Page 332 I
"All I'm asking is how do you, as a researcher and scientist, figure out whether something is statistically significant as opposed to just being a little different?",You do a statistical test to make that comparison.
All right. And I assume that was done on this study?,Yes.
"Do you, sir well, first of all, have you looked at the results and looked at the statistical study which was performed on the results comparing Marlboro Light smokers to Marlboro Full Flavor smokers?","Yes, I have looked at the results, but it's been as you saw, it was published in 2008, so it's been a while."
"Yeah, sure. I understand that. So you have personally worked out the calculations; c o r r e c t ?","If you're asking me whether I personally did the calculations and the statistical analysis, the answer is no. This was done through a CRO who has statisticians who did the analysis."
"Do you, sir, agree or disagree, in looking at the results of this study as reflected in Table 3-A, which is the short-phase part of the study, that the differences between higher tar and nicotine yield Marlboro full flavor cigarettes and Marlboro Lights, lower yield tar and nicotine cigarettes, when it comes to exposure to risks that were measured in the study were not significant differences?","So, you know, as we agreed that it's hard for me to draw a specific inference about Table 3, but I can definitely tell you that I feel convinced that the results from this study show that lower yield results in lower exposure on an average. There's a lower exposure in smokers."
"Well, sir, with all due respect, believe me I know what you feel. My question, sir, is having looked at this study and having read this paper, recognizing it's been sometime ago, and being familiar with statistical analysis, would you not agree, sir, that the comparison of exposure to harmful smoke constituents and nicotine were not significant for those smokers of Marlboro Lights, low tar and nicotine yield cigarettes, and Marlboro Full flavor, high tar and nicotine cigarettes, in the short-phase study, as reflected in Table 3-A?","So based on my, you know, analysis of the science from this study and from other studies, I would say that"
"I'm going to use the term ""With all due respect"" one more time, Dr. Sarkar, that wasn't my question. My question is based upon your review of this study and your review of this paper that we have been discussing. Do you, sir, agree or disagree that in the short-phase part of the study, the results of which are reflected in Table 3 in the paper, there were no significant differences for smokers of Marlboro Lights, so-called lower tar and nicotine cigarettes, as compared to the smokers of Marlboro Full Flavor, higher tar and nicotine cigarettes?",
"And it's certainly fair, Doctor, for you to say that. You can say, ""I don't know if it showed a difference or not. I haven't looked at the table in a while."" I'm just asking if you agree or disagree with that.","I would say that generally I would disagree. Because based on my recollection from the results of the study, we had seen a difference in people who switched to lower tar cigarettes."
"All right. Turning next, quickly, to the long phase of the study, 24 weeks of participation by the smokers under conditions where they were unconstrained use or they had unconstrained use in their daily lives of cigarettes, the results reflected in Table 3-B do not show a statistically significant difference in the exposure to harmful constituents and nicotine in the cigarettes of full flavor smokers and light smokers; correct?",I don't recall the results that you are talking about. 0 BY MR. CABANISS:
"Now, there was actually a later article paper published by the same group of people in the Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology. It's found in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, 55, 2009, pages 17 to 27. Are you familiar with that particular paper, sir?","Yes, I think the study was the results from the total exposure study, I believe."
"Yes, it was the same they're reporting it again, but they're now not talking about the purpose for the original study. In other words, they didn't choose to emphasize the results defined by the actual study design, did they?","I think you may have gotten the studies confused. Let me just give you some background. So we had done two studies. One was the total exposure study where we had several thousands of smokers in a cross-sectional setting and we measured the exposure as a cross-section. When I say cross-section, these were people who were using these products on a regular basis. This is a totally different study than the previous publication that you were talking about, which was a randomized clinical trial. We had two different studies. This goes back to what I was saying earlier, that it just reinforces that both of these studies, along with the evidence, showed consistently that lower yield results in lower exposure."
"Well, there's too much for me to go through with you on this paper, Doctor. So I will wait until we get together in October of this year. I have one final area. We were talking before about lower risk products. Has Philip Morris come up with any products I know you talked about I think the heated cigarette. Have they come up with any other products they believe are more of a risk, other than cigarettes?",
Does Philip Morris produce or market a smokeless tobacco product?,"Altria does. I'm not sure whether Philip Morris makes and markets the smokeless tobacco products, but the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company makes a number of smokeless tobacco products."
"You are not familiar with Philip Morris selling something called I call it Snus, but I think I heard people call it Snus? It's spelled S-n-u-s.","Yes, I'm very familiar with that. I am afraid I can't comment on who makes it, whether U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company makes it or if it's manufactured at Philip Morris, so I don't know the answer to your question. The answer is definitely yes. We, as Altria Holding Company, one of us makes and markets Snus and other smokeless tobacco products."
"Now, it's you-all's position that that product is a lower risk product, particularly for cancer, than cigarettes; correct?","The reason I'm hesitating is because it's obvious, right. And there's a substantial amount of scientific evidence that supports that, you know, if smokers switch to smokeless tobacco products, their risk for many of the smoking relating diseases is reduced."
"All right. So you folks have a product, a product that delivers nicotine, that is lower risk to smokers than smoking cigarettes; right?",Right. That and other smokeless tobacco products would generally fit that category because you are not smoking or you're not combusting tobacco. You are taking it orally.
"Okay. You have made that known publicly, that smokeless tobacco Altria Group smokeless tobacco is much lower risk when it comes to disease than smoking cigarettes; right?","Well, this goes back to the conversation we were having earlier, you know, regulatory authority of FDA. We would have to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to get them the scientific evidence. And we cannot communicate about lowering the risk of the product until the FDA reviews that message and approves it. So, no, we cannot communicate the lower risk profile of our smokeless products without FDA authorization. That's why we were we wanted to get FDA regulation, so that we have a regulator who reviews the evidence and, you know, gives us authorization to make that communication to the consumers."
"You-all did, in fact I don't recall the specific date, but in the 2000s somewhere, you-all did, in fact, write the United States Surgeon General and ask the Surgeon General in effect to formally recognize the much lower risk of smokeless tobacco products that Philip Morris manufactured and sold than smoking cigarettes, did you not?","Generally, that's correct, yes."
"And the Surgeon General at that time wrote back and said, in essence, ""I and this office are not going to endorse any tobacco product""; correct?","I don't know the specifics of his response. It's been a while. But it comes back to the discussion that we had a few minutes ago. That's the reason why FDA becomes such an important and integral part of our harm reduction efforts. And FDA we said that there were a number of products in the pipeline that we want FDA to review and make a determination whether we can communicate the lower risk trial of the different products that we are working on. And FDA would then make the authorization, based on the scientific evidence, whether it's appropriate for public health."
"Are you saying, Dr. Sarkar, back to the specific question I asked you, that when you-all wrote the Surgeon General and told him how much lower risk smokeless Philip Morris or Altria smokeless tobacco is than cigarettes and to come out in support of this, are you saying that you do not know whether or not he wrote back refusing to endorse any tobacco product?","No, sir. What I am saying is that I do recollect that he wrote back generally the terms that you are describing. But the important thing that let me finish."
"Dr. Sarkar, my question, sir, is after your company wrote to the Surgeon General of the United States and told him that you-all had smokeless tobacco products which you were selling that had a lower reduced risk of exposure to harm, and asked him basically to endorse that, let that be known, the Surgeon General wrote back and, in essence, replied that he was not going to endorse any tobacco product. True?","I'm sorry. I can't answer that question because I'm not sure whether we asked him to endorse, as you put it, so I can't answer that question."
"Well, you asked him, in essence, to move forward with it and get this information out and that sort of thing; correct?","I don't recollect the specifics of what we asked him, so I don't feel comfortable answering your question."
"Well, you said earlier you were aware of it.","What I said was I was aware that we had sent the information to the Surgeon General. But I was not aware I'm not aware of what was the specific content of what we asked him. I don't know whether we asked him to, quote-unquote, endorse, as you put it."
"Well, take the word ""endorse"" out. You did send information to the Surgeon General to advise him that you-all had smokeless tobacco products that were a lot less risky than smoking cigarettes; correct?",Right. What we sent to him was a compilation of all the scientific evidence that demonstrated that smokeless tobacco was less risky than cigarettes.
And what did you-all ask him to do in that letter about this subject for which you were sending him this information?,"I can't answer that question one way or the other, because I don't remember the specifics of what we asked him to do. I don't want to misquote."
"Now, my very simple question is the Surgeon General wrote a letter back to you folks that, in essence, said he was not going to endorse or suggest that any tobacco product was safe for use; correct?",I'm going to say the same thing. I can't answer the question one way or the other because I wasn't privy to what was the response of the Surgeon General. I've not read that letter. I can't answer that question.
You haven't ever seen the letter that was written by the Surgeon General in response to you-all supplying information about smokeless tobacco products being less risky than cigarettes?,I don't recollect reading that letter.
"Okay. Fair enough. Well, I want you to assume well, let me just ask you this question: Are you aware then that your company took the letter of what they sent to the Surgeon General and the Surgeon General's response and disseminated it to the public?",
"Did you u n d e r s t a n d my q u e s t i o n , Doctor?",I'm not sure I heard a question.
"I'm sorry. Are you aware, sir, that your company took what it wrote to the Surgeon General about smokeless tobacco products being far less risky than smoking cigarettes and what the Surgeon General said in response and then provided that to various public health organizations, public health figures? Are you aware of that?","No, I'm not."
"Now, you are generally aware of and I think you've said that smokeless tobacco products have less risk than smoking cigarettes, right? I'm just asking that to lead into my last question.",Yes.
"You are aware, are you not, sir, that in the past the people running Philip Morris have stated that they have told the public that if they ever found anything harmful in their cigarette smoke, they would remove it? Are you aware of that?",Y e s .
"Are you also aware, sir, that it has been further stated to the public by the head people at Philip Morris that if they found something harmful that caused lung cancer from the smoke of their cigarette, they would shut down their plant? Are you aware of that?",Are you referring to any specific statement made by any individual?
"No, sir. I'm just asking if you are aware that people who have talked at Philip Morris have in the past made the statement that if they found that there was something harmful in the smoke of their cigarettes that they couldn't remove, they would close down their plants? Are you aware of that statement having been made?","That's a very broad, general question so I can't answer that question. 2 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"What do you mean it's a broad, general question? Have you ever heard of anybody up at the top of Philip Morris who made such a statement at any time? Heard or read it?","Well, what do you mean by top if you could be a little more specific, I can answer the question."
"I mean people who were chief executive officers, chairmen, people who were at the top of the decision-making management. Are you aware of any statements by people like that at Philip Morris, that if they couldn't get rid of harmful things in their tobacco smoke, they would shut down their plants?",I can't answer the question one way or the other. It's too general. I don't recall. It's too general a question. I can't answer that question.
"So your testimony is you don't recall having read, seen, or heard a statement by anyone representing or on behalf of Philip Morris to that effect; correct?","Sitting over here, Philip Morris has represented many things and I can't recall everything that they have said. So I don't feel comfortable answering that question."
"Well, I want you to assume that both of these things were said by representatives of Philip Morris, that if they found something harmful in their cigarette smoke, they would remove it; and that if there was something in the cigarette smoke that was causing harm, and that specific harm being lung cancer, that they would shut down their plants. I want you to assume these statements were made. Based upon where we are today, none of those statements have been adhered to or validated or accomplished by Philip Morris; true?","Well, sitting over here, you know, hypotheticals are hypotheticals. Assumptions are something I don't feel comfortable responding to. I'm sure if they made the statement, they knew what they were talking about. And I can't get into the minds of what they meant by it. That's all I would say about that. 2 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"Well, you may not be able to get into their minds, search for their intention or their motivation in making such statements. But if those statements were made to the citizens of this country, it would be a fact that as of today Philip Morris has not complied with what these top people told the public they would do; correct?","Once again, I don't know what they said or did not say to the public. What I do know is what I've seen and experienced. We continue to make efforts to reduce the harm from our products and we continue to comply with the regulations and we will continue to do so to try to make cigarettes less harmful. We have decades of work behind us and we have more work to do ahead of us."
"Thank you for that answer, Dr. Sarkar. If those two statements, ""If we find something harmful, we will take it out,"" and, ""If we can't take it out, we will shut down our plants,"" have not been honored and complied with by Philip Morris, simple question, and the simple answer is yes ?",
Do you not agree?,"No. All I'm going to say is what r\ *N.-% {%.-% -' f W I know. What I've experienced is we continue to make efforts I have spent my career at Philip Morris working on reducing the harm from our products. And we continue to strive to make our cigarettes less harmful, and we will continue our efforts."
"Dr. Sarkar, believe me, I am not intending to question your motivation, your dedication, and your efforts. I really am not. My simple question is you would have to agree, sir, that if those statements were made by representatives at the top of Philip Morris, that if they found something harmful in their cigarettes, they would reduce it; and if they couldn't not reduce, but eliminate it. And if they couldn't eliminate it, they would shut down their plants; that simply hasn't been done, has it?","You know, the first part of the question I think bears some explanation. If you look at, you know, the whole decades of research that's going on I have looked at the scientific evidence and I still don't know whether we have found the constituent or constituents that can be linked to lung cancer. And the National Cancer Institute continues to spend money on trying to understand what is it in specific that causes lung cancer. And as I said, you know, we have continued our effort over the years to try to approach this from a general exposure reduction. We have all these different programs that are in place to try to reduce it. This is not just one single chemical that you can take out and make the cigarette safer. I think the only safe cigarette is the one that's not smoked."
Not smoked or not made?,Not smoked. Adults have the choice to use the product knowing the risk of the product.
"And if the product is not made, if the promise that was made in the past by the top people at Philip Morris was fulfilled, the smoker wouldn't have to make that choice; correct?","Well, I can't sit here and answer the question whether the promise was made or not. But cigarettes are a legal product and FDA has authorized that we can make these products and they're right now legal. And we continue to make our efforts to try to figure out what is in cigarette smoke that makes it harmful and make it less harmful. And that's the fact."
"And you have a product already that recognizes being much less harmful than smoking cigarettes. And with that knowledge, you could fulfill the promises of the past and make smokeless tobacco products and not put out cigarettes for people to smoke. True?","Well, as I've said, we have various avenues through FDA to, you know, communicate the lower risk profile of our smokeless products. FDA would have to review it and make a determination of the best way to facilitate the switching from cigarettes to smokeless products. And we are approaching and in talks with FDA and making considerations of the best path forward. FDA is the ultimate regulatory body that will make a decision whether we can make that communication to consumers. 4 BY MR. CABANISS:"
"Well, Dr. Sarkar, I mean you personally no disrespect. I hope you understand that. But would you agree that as the manufacturer of tobacco products, Philip Morris, Altria cannot escape its ultimate responsibility for the harm, injury, and death caused by its products by saying its the FDA's job?","I'm not sure what you're referring to. But I can tell you that in terms of being responsible manufacturers of a product, we take every step in all aspects of a business to be responsible. And at the end of the day, we continue to make efforts to lower the risk profile of our products. And when the time comes, FDA will make the determination and we will be able to communicate to the consumers."
"Don't you agree, sir, that you, as a manufacturer of cigarettes and now smokeless tobacco, who has been designing, developing, and manufacturing cigarettes for decades and decades and decades have much more responsibility to the public of this country than a regulatory agency like the Food and Drug Administration?","Well, as I said, you know, we are responsible manufacturers of tobacco products. That's built into our mission statement. And we continue to have ongoing efforts on many different aspects of our business to fulfill our responsibility. FDA is just a venue, a regulatory body that allows us to fulfill one of these responsibilities, which is to if you have a lower risk product, to review the scientific evidence and make the determination of whether we can market it and what we can say about this product to consumers."
