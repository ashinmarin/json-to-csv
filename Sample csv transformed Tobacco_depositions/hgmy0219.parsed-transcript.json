Any company interested in obtaining 4 information on teenagers' use of their products or teenagers' attitudes toward their products can participate. With this kind of multiple sponsorship we can offer a very attractive price to individual participants. The sample for the ORC teen study will consist of 1,000 teenagers and will be a nationwide probability sample. Personal interviews will be conducted by our trained ORC resident interviewers. Since teenagers currently constitute a portion of the cigarette market and are continually entering that market, we think this research service will be of interest to you. We have developed a 30 or 40-minute presentation which covers all the teenage market and discusses how to reach it effectively, as well as describing in detail what the ORC teen study can do. \"I would like to come to Richmond and do this presentation for those people to whom you think this would be of their interest. May I suggest January 24th, January 25th, either morning or afternoon is possible. 0 \"Thanks?\" Correct?"

Its sales are almost exclusively to teenagers, and it is possible these teenagers are switching away from Greens before entering the college age level, which would account for Green sales dropping off greatly when outside of a high school area. However, more time is needed to track the teenagers during this age transition. The teenage market is very changeable. And although Greens are strong in Grand Rapids now, it can change without warning. One store owner...\" parentheses \"...(located near a high school)...\" close parens \"...pointed out that a 0 salesman from Lorillard came by passing out Newport samplers of 4s to the students, and since then his sales of Newport went from 2 to 15 cartons a week. \"I feel that students will stay loyal to a 4 brand due to peer group influence, not because of the brand itself. This makes for an uncertain market. \"I also feel that Marlboro Reds are not being hurt by the success of Greens in Grand Rapids. Most of the Marlboro Menthol market is comprised of teenagers who for the most part are probably new smokers rather than brand switchers.\" Did I read that correctly?",
