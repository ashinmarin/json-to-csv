The scientists within Reynolds did net believe that it was appropriate to change the means by which cause and effect relationships should be established, nor could the scientists at Reynolds determine what types of causative agents would be responsible to have that cause and effect relationship. They oould find toxicants in smoke. They obuld find carcinogens in smoke, but they oould not find them in sufficient enough quantities to suggest that that it would cause human disease. There's a distinction in what I'm trying to say bjatween establishing cause and effect relationship, which is what TI was talking about, and what I was talking about in terms of what scientists believed ahd the belief that whether or not something might bo a danger.

Eventually, such data would be persuasive enough to mark a perceptual shift to, quote, a new kind of numeracy among medical researchers and olinioians alike, but in 1964 most physicians were not prepared to understand muoh less be persuaded by -- the epidemiological data represented in the report, nor to incorporate a public health model into their medical practice."

In '64 I think as the Surgeon General in 2000 points out they changed the dynamics somewhat and more relied on on -- on s^ts of data that would allow for the publio health community to react quickly. So but the previous way in which you would develop cause and effect relationships would have -- would have required lines of evidence around mechanistic understanding of the disease formation, definitive causative agents, provide a variety of models that one oould upci and test to the location of the disease, animal VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 o CD CD http://www.veritext.com c c c m* m* models that one could use to reproduce results, so a lot of those things I mentioned earlier on were all part and parcel to how cause and effect relationships were previous prior to 1964 were established.

C (202.296*8434) QpTOBBiUl, l?f6 T0OC774 Tobacco Institute Comments on \"Tar\" and Nicotine Washington - The Tobacco Institute today issued the following statement ln| reaponee to inquiries concerning a forthcoming magasins article, and earlier published reports on die subject of \"tar\" and nicotine: c The increasing attention in recent weeks to the subject of \"tar\" and nicotine appears to reflect a conaiderable amount of misunderstanding and confusion about this subject. While some scientists believe that \"tar\" and nicotine are harmful, other scientists do not agree. Wa know of no valid scientific evidence demonatratlng that either \"tar\" or nicotine is responsible for any human illness. Even those who maintain that smoking is harmful have not been able to establish that any particular ingredient in cigarette smoke eauses human dteease. With respect to nicotine, the report on Smoking and Health of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee points out that \"There is no acceptable evidence that prolonged exposure to nicotine creates either dangerous functional change of an objective nature or degenerative disease.\" The report goes on to state that nicotine \"probably does not represent a significant health problem. \"yt0** There is no \"tar\" In cigarette smoke, and smoke Is not \"tar.\" \"Tar\" la the name givsn to some of the components In smoke tihet can be collected by Moratory techniques. ^ ^ ^ ^ . LPJ>616.0001 en \"Nl o CD O c - 2 - . ' JJC7 , \\J The growing emphasis on \"tar\" and nicotine can mielead and con- fuae the public inaofar as it suggests that science has established human health atgniflcamce for \"tar\" and nicotine* At best, such a suggestion is a matter of opinion and guesswork. Former Surgson General Terry said in testimony last ysar before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee: \"While it seems at leaat plausible that cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine may present lesser health hasards, there ia presently no proof that this is so.\" Nor is there any scientific proof today that \"tar\" and nicotine has aignificance In terms of human health. Scientists throughout the world are continuing to investigate to learn the full facta about \"tar\" and nicotine, and about questions concern* lng tobacco and health. The tobacco industry ia supporting much of tills research and will continue to do so. 00O00 TIMN 0099041. LP 0616.0002 w *NJ o CD O O) wsc. ft * * f .' > i /***-. c ("
