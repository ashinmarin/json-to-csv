"Now, before you testified in the Sherman case, what kind of preparation did you undertake?","I did a lot of reading. I spent a good deal of time learning the history of Reynolds, learning the history of Reynolds' R&D, understanding what the company positions had been over that many decade timeframe. I would meet with the lawyers about once a week for an hour or two to talk about the issues that come up in litigation, discuss that. I had questions about what is it like in the courtroom, what is it like to be deposed, because I wanted to be prepared. So that's the kind of preparation I had."
"Okay. And then how long did this preparation -- obviously, it would take a while to review 50 years of research and history. How long did it take you to review and prepare for the first time? A, Approximately, about a year, I would say. I think I began -- I know when I became vice president of product development in 2008 is when my boss had asked if I would consider being a company representative.

"Okay. Besides the filter, what other changes to cigarette design since the 50s have made cigarettes safer?","Again, from -- and it's -- I certainly testified to this before, but a whole host of changes had occurred to cigarettes and cigarette design technology in an effort to reduce tar. That was the directive both from a public health perspective and public health authorities, making those assertions that the reduction of tar would help reduce risk. So things like more reconstituted tobacco; the use of stems in cigarettes to reduce tar was accomplished; the development, implementation of expanded tobacco to act as dilly way was accomplished and utilized in ro 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 sg Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 ^ / "" V I L M JTi/""Yf Tl>T* |r^|^i^j^YJ nPIXI/*1* Pagc35 cigarette design; better filters, more efficient x i i L s i b / 1111cx u i i u i i o i i , xeoucxxion ox cixounixerence of the cigarette; really a host of technologies which I've -- obviously, I've testified to many of these in the past --"
Sure.,-- all helped to try to reduce tar and nicotine delivery to the smoker.
I know that the idea was that these design changes would help. I guess what I want to know is if they did help?,"Again, to a certain degree, they did. Certainly, if you read surgeon generals reports, public health reports from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, the suggestions from public health were if people continued to smoke, they should smoke lower tar cigarettes, all based on the belief that dose and toxicity would make a difference. That somehow changed in 2000 with Monograph 13. But, yet, even with Monograph 13, if you read Monograph 13, they do suggest that there is a reduction in lung cancer rates as a -- largely attributed to cigarette design. Although, as they pointed out, that was a small reduction in lung cancer rates. So, again, --"
"From RJR's point of view -- waaHBWBwwwaiMwwwB^^ 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING From our -- -- did any of the design changes that you just mentioned decrease the risk of cigarettes? I believe they decreased it to some degree, yeah. Okay. I do believe that. I believe what the epidemiology says and has said for decades. I also believe that that reduction is not large enough, that that reduction was not as large as both the cigarette companies as well as public health thought it would have, and so, therefore, you see some of the things that were done at Reynolds to take a different path: Things like the development of Premier and Eclipse and moving in different directions in terms of looking at the public health issues related to tobacco products. Did -- How much did it reduce the risk? All these design changes from the 50s, how much did it reduce the risk of traditional cigarettes? I don't know, I'm not an epidemiologist. But, from what I understand, there was a reduction between certainly non filtered cigarettes and filtered cigarettes. I don't know what that number is. And, again, I would go by what I read in Monograph 13 that there was some reduction. I don't know if I can put 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING a number on it. I don't know if they put a number on it. | Was it statistically significant? I would say it was, yeah. And, certainly, the epidemiological reports between non filters and filters, at the time they came out in the 50's, 60's and 70's, certainly indicated that. Do you know what percentage of the population was smoking a filtered cigarette in 1960? In 1960, it would have been less. There were -- Filters had became popular after Winston came out in 1954. So by 1960, I wouldn't -- I don't think it was s half at that point, but certainly as you move through the 60's, it certainly rapidly increased. And, you know, where we are today, obviously, there's very few people that smoke non filtered cigarettes and almost everybody is smoking not only filtered cigarettes, but lower yielding cigarettes. Were the filters added to cigarettes for safety reasons?",". weeks ago on that issue. So* yeah/ I'm generally aware of that. Do you know what the rise in adenocarcinoma is attributed to? Well, I don't know exactly. I think the surgeon general and others may have suggested that cigarette design plays a role. But, like I said, the latest paper I've read, that the adenocarcinoma rates have not only increased for cigarette smokers but it's also increased for non smokers. So, if the adeno rates in non smokers is increasing in a similar way to cigarette smokers, then one can't attribute that to cigarette design, or at least they can't fully attribute that to cigarette design. Do you know who wrote the study you're referring to? I think it was Lee, L-e-e. Is it on your reliance list? I don't know if it's on there yet, because it's reaiiy a recent article, out it will oe.

What about the strips; how are the strips made?,"The strips were made, I believe the final version was an extruded strip, as well as the sticks were also, I believe, extruded. So they went through an extruder."
What is an extruder?,"Well, it's like a spaghetti maker. So, that's what you're doing when you do make spaghetti. Or think like of a meat grinder, for instance. You grind up -- stick a New York strip in there, you grind it up, and out comes a bunch of thin, small strips of meat, ground meat. So an extruder works similarly. You take a bunch of powdered materials, maybe add some water, you make basically a paste and then you apply pressure and you put it through a formed dicast head that then will leave you with the shape that you want. In the case of the stick, it came out in the form basically like spaghetti and then you would lay it out, you would dry it, you would cut it, etcetera, And the strip was similar, except it was like a flat - imagine like a flat noodle.

I smoked Camel, Camel Lights pretty much the whole time until I worked for Brown & Williamson, Then I didn't smoke a Reynolds product when I worked for Brown & Williamson. I used Lucky Strike Lights, Then I participated and helped develop a product called Advance, which was a potentially lower yielding product that had a special filter on it that I helped design, and I used -- I smoked Advance, which came out in 2001 and smoked that product until I quit in '04.

When you say --,The mouth full of smoke is different.
"When you say impact, what do you mean?","I mean the amount of irritation that one gets in the mouth and in the throat and, of course, that modulates what kind of behavior you want. So I think when you're a smoker, you puff on a product, if it's your own product, you already you would know what size puff you want to take because you have your preferences. If you smoke a different brand, then your first instinct is to puff on it like it was your own cigarette. Well, you're going to figure out right away whether or not that cigarette is yielding 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING more or less and change the behavior to get the desired amount of sensation that you want. What causes that sensation? The amount of smoke that comes out the back of the w HL VJ d JL w L*- t* G* Is there less smoke in a light cigarette than a full flavor cigarette? Less smoke? Ultimately, under -- I mean, under standard smoking conditions, absolutely, there is. And it's very difficult to overcome that. So filters do work. So when you have a higher efficiency filter and more dilution, whether it's on a machine or you put it in your mouth, you're going to, in all likelihood, get less. Obviously, smokers can compensate to a certain degree and generate more smoke out of a product. But, when you look at the design variables between a full flavor or lights or ultralights product, the full flavor products are designed to yield more smoke. They have a lot of them have more tobacco in them, they have a lower efficiency filter, they may not have any ventilation, so, yeah.

You don't It's hard to say there's -- 1 mean, there's no smoke in a cigarette until you light it up. Okay? Right. So the terminology is what is the yield of the product from the smoke and what do we actually measure. It's not the smoke. What we're measuring is we're measuring the particulate matter of the smoke. Okay? That's what.we can physically measure. The smoke is both particulate phase material as well as gases and those things you have to look at differently. Is there more particulate matter in a full flavored cigarette or a light cigarette?

That does not mean, however, that somebody who smokes a light cigarette can't generate as much smoke or be exposed to as much smoke as somebody smoking a full flavored cigarette. That can happen and does happen. But, on average, when we look at hundreds of smokers and we collect their filters and we find out what comes out at the end of that filter and we look at those design. changes, what we see on average is a decrease in the amount that came out of that filter for those smokers.

"So is it -- Well, I don't know that I understood your answer.","The government runs very large epidemiological studies and has since the 50's. The big problem in trying to understand the health consequences of smoking is there is a large lag time between when somebody and how somebody has a behavior and when that behavior may manifest itself in a disease. Hence, when you're looking at smokers, because the -- Because what they may be exposed to has changed over that time -- over a very long timeframe, if you really want to segregate out -- and you want to answer your question, do light cigarettes provide a benefit versus filtered cigarettes --then, the way to do that is to take a perspective group of people who only have smoked full flavored cigarettes and find out what their disease rates are and then look at another group of people that have only used light cigarettes and find out what their disease rates are. ^ 1 XXXdL- *L> V c l y LXXl l X U l X X b L* w LAO t"

Okay. How much? It all depends on what we put in it. So for certain flavors, the vast majority of what is comprised in the liquid of an e-cigarette is vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, a little bit of water and whatever flavor we put on. So, now, the flavor is where you would have the largest number of individual chemicals because those flavors can be complicated and some are not. For menthol, for instance, we really don't have much of anything other than a little bit of natural menthol, PG glycerin and water, so when you look at the -- if you do a GC analysis of an e-cigarette aerosol and a cigarette aerosol, it's like looking at night and day. So you look at cigarette smoke aerosol from combustion and you look at all those peaks, it's like looking through a forest of grass. You look at an E-cigarette GC and there's just a couple of peaks. So, are you -- Is it your testimony that there are under ten chemicals in an electronic cigarette? I'm not testifying to that. What I'm saying is the number of chemicals that can be identified in the aerosol of an e-cigarette is significantly and greatly less than regular cigarettes and it will be 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING XT. . proportional to what comprises that E liquid.

Was the TIRC created to be the public voice of the tobacco industry? To a certain degree it was, yeah, and certainly that's what the Tobacco Institute became was really the public voice representative trade association for. tobacco.

"Well, when you were growing up, what was R.J, Reynolds Tobacco Company's position on whether or not smoking causes lung cancer?","Well, their position would have been that there's an association between cigarette smoking and disease, 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING Pago but you couldn't necessarily establish that it was a cause and effect relationship because there wasn't enough information. Now, as time moved on and as I grew up, that position would have changed slightly. Certainly, by the late 80's and early 90's, R.J. Reynolds would have suggested that it was a significant risk factor in the development of disease, which, in fact, it is.

Okay. And was that R.J. Reynolds' definition of addiction at the time?,It was a classical definition. We had no reason and never had disputed that definition when the surgeon general used it in '64.

And that's when the original definition was laid out where I was talking about how there has to be an intoxication associated with drugs of addiction. That is not how nicotine was classified then, even though there were scientists, and had been scientists for decades prior to '64, that said nicotine was addictive, And the surgeon general even quotes in '64 a couple of papers by individuals that classified nicotine as addiction, but decided that it didn't fit that definition.

Does Reynolds have to disclose its additives it uses to anyone else? Sure. We've Reynolds, and all the tobacco companies, have made additive disclosures to the health and human services department of the U.S. government since about 1986, so going on 30 years. We also make additive discloses to certain states that ask for them, as well as the FDA, which not only doesn't just want the list of additives, but they 2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING 7. .

With respect to the department of health and human services disclosure since 1986, what is your understanding, if you know, doctor, as to what obligation DHHS has, if it has concerns, about an additive the company indicated they are using? If they had a concern about an additive that the companies were using, they were to notify congress and get that additive removed. That was the authority they had with obtaining the list. In the I guess almost 30 years that Reynolds and the other manufacturers have been providing their additive information to DHHS, to your knowledge, have they ever notified congress that they had a concern about one of the additives? Not to this point. FDA Does FDA have oversight over the additives that Reynolds uses? Certainly, they do. Okay.

Reconstituted tobacco sheet, as compared to the in-feed materials, in-feed tobacco that goes into making that, how does the nicotine level compare in finished reconstituted tobacco sheet as it relates to the in-feed materials that go in to making it?

Well, in some types of reconstituted tobacco sheet, you end up getting more what you would call smoky or nutty roasted flavors developing. Ammonia sugar chemistry is quite a well known phenomenon in food and other industries and these reactions, called mallard reactions, happen when ammoniated compounds and sugars react, And they're pleasant from an aroma standpoint and a taste standpoint. So that's another reason to use them. And there is plenty of ammonia in tobacco. There is ammonia in tobacco, but added ammonia will help propagate those kind of reactions.

Specifically, for menthol products, those nutty dark aromas don't really go that well with menthol products, so that's one where the shoe doesn't fit. With respect to ammonia, are you aware of any public health authority, whether it's the FDA or anyone else, that has concluded that a cigarette with added ammonia is more dangerous or addictive than a cigarette without added ammonia? Never have I seen any documentation which would suggest that. Okay. And I apologize, looping back to reconstituted tobacco sheet. Have you seen that the FDA or any other government or public health authority, to your knowledge, concluded that the use of reconstituted tobacco sheets make cigarettes more dangerous or more addictive than they already are? Certainly nothing on addictive. Quite the opposite.

"Now, I want to switch topics a little bit, but I want to stay on the same sort of topic. You were asked some questions about carcinogens in tobacco and tobacco smoke. Let me first start out with does Reynolds add carcinogens to its cigarettes?","No, we do not."
"To your knowledge, has it ever done so?","Not that I'm aware of, no."
Why are there carcinogens present in tobacco smoke?,"Carcinogens are in tobacco smoke because when you burn organic material, you generate carcinogens through the combustion.-- through incomplete combustion. That's,what I was trying to explain before. You burn anything, any organic material, really, you're going to form things like benzine and PAH's and other things that are known to be carcinogenic. So it's the consequence of the burning is why you have such a high amount of carcinogens. Now, there are some carcinogens that are in tobacco from the degradation of nicotine and those things are called nitrosamines, the ones in tobacco are specific to tobacco, tobacco specific nitrosamines, and z~i mere s a coupie or rnose mar. are carcinogenic. /\nct they are there before you set it on fire. And 2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING Page 243 J there's heavy metals in tobacco. Why? Because they're in the soil and it's a growing plant and it picks them up, so things like cadmium, which may be a carcinogen, can be found in tobacco and in tobacco smoke, but that is, again, inherent in the tobacco."
"In your opinion, doctor, and as someone who is in charge of cigarette product development at Reynolds, does anything Reynolds does to the cigarettes increase the amount of carcinogens in cigarettes?","No, and we specifically, through our product stewardship program, when we do new designs or issue out new products or try to make- changes to the product, we specifically look to make sure that we don't increase that risk. That's what the whole point of the stewardship program is about."
"As it relates to general reduction in the techniques x / tfiat we discussed and m e overall eiions TO reduce tar and nicotine over time, did those general reduction techniques have an effect on the carcinogens and the yield of carcinogens in cigarette smoke?","Yeah. I mean, general reduction techniques generally reduce everything to do with tar, and specifically the toxicants and carcinogens in that tar, so it serves to reduce them.

"Okay. Now, I want to contrast that market with Reynolds VUSE product. How is VUSE different than what you described, the overall e-cigarette market, 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 , CD O Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING to be. How does VUSE compare?","Well, VUSE is quite different in that -- and, look, there's not anything necessarily wrong with this, but most of those devices are made in China and the quality control can, at times, be suspect. Then, of course, there's some very fine products that come out of China at the same time. But, for Reynolds, what we felt was important was we felt it was very important for us to have control over the cartridge manufacture for VUSE and the e-liquid manufacturing, and control over that production. So we automated a means by which we could make those cartridges. Now what -- the cartridges in China -- and we've been over there a bunch -- are made by hand, literally by groups of individuals, men and women, sitting at long tables -assembling these cartridges by hand, so we felt that that' was a quality control issue. Certainly, it's fine to have a hand crafted chair, it's quite another thing to have a hand crafted assembled part, and it's never the quality control is never as good as you can get when you can automate and have machines do it. So we automated and invented automated equipment to make our cartridges. We have a proprietary and unique system by which the cartridge connects to a battery, so you 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING can only use a VUSE cartridge with a VUSE battery. We implemented battery safety controls, over-charge protection, so that the battery, lithium-ion battery, so that it doesn't explode on charging, which I'm sure people have seen that happen with lithium-ion batteries. In fact, I was watching the TV the other night. Those hoverboards that everybody wants for Christmas, they seem to be blowing up all the time. That's a lithium-ion battery malfunction. So if you don't have the proper battery control systems in place from the charging mechanism perspective, they can catch fire. So, we've instituted those types of control. So a whole variety of those type of quality controls we've put in place in the manufacture of VUSE as well as parts testing and stewardship of the product. So -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to ramble on and on about it. Where is VUSE assembled and manufactured? t\lCjliL. Up L.iie S L I 6 6 L 111 lODuCCOVlJ . J .6 < XIIC C o I L l l Q y j 6 o are made in Tobaccoville.

It's difficult to -- It would be very difficult to tamper with and, as I said, the cartridge itself, once the time runs out on that cartridge, it shuts off, it can't be shut back on. So even if somebody wanted to, say, use a syringe and jam some liquid msiQc a vubJii carrriQge, ii it was an expiree cartridge, you could put the liquid in there but you couldn't use it, because the VUSE battery recognizes that cartridge is dead. You've got two --you've got a battery chip and you've got a cartridge chip and they talk to one another and it helps control that system, so it's pretty clever in that sense. Are you aware of any other e-cigarettes manufactured that has that kind of technology that VUSE has? Not that I'm aware of, no. One other issue on how VUSE may be different from another -- you mentioned in response to Mr. Gale's question about people cranking the voltage up on some of these e-cigarettes. What safeguards did Reynolds put in place with VUSE with respect to that issue?"
"What are one of the -- some of the potential concerns if people were to be able to increase the voltage on the e-cigarettes? I realize they can't do it with VUSE, but other e-cigarettes that they crank the voltage up, what are some of the potential issues with doing that?","Well, you can You know, look, when you start getting if you start applying more energy to the system, you're likely.to create more heat and if you start to break that heat threshold, you can start to char and you can start to burn and you can start to potentially combust the e-liquid itself. So, you know, there's not a lot of magic in the e-liquid. There's glycerin and propylene glycol and flavors and 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING Q A Q A nicotine. And when you burn glycerin, you're going to make potential toxicants, I mean, there's glycerin is cigarettes, it's an organic compound. What happens when you start to burn things is you start to make toxicants and carcinogens potentially. So the idea in the power regulation is to make sure that you're regulating the power sufficient to make an aerosol, our you oon *c want tuEt WICK to get very hot and that was you avoid degradation of the e-liquid to form potential toxicants. That doesn't say -- it doesn't mean it won't happen, but you want to minimize that potential as much as possible. That safeguard and the other safeguard you talked about, including product stewardship and making sure you're using quality ingredients and stuff, are there any existing today current regulations that require Reynolds to adopt or pursue all of those safeguards? None at all. In fact, the FDA has considered e-cigarettes to be a deemed product, but have yet to issue their guidance or their regulations yet. So right now, it's in essence an unregulated product. And despite the fact it was unregulated, Reynolds took all those additional steps voluntarily? We did. We believe that this was a potential significant benefit for potentially public health, 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 CD O Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING A j \ . certainly a significant benefit and step for our migration philosophy. So we wanted to make sure we didn't do things - we knew the FDA was going to come and regulate those products, but we wanted to make sure we were doing everything as the best way we i could prior to that, to set the standard for the j industry. | And are there any -- We talked about cigarette package warnings that have been on since 1966. \ Currently, are any warnings -- federal warnings required to be on e-cigarettes, including VUSE? There are no requirements, no. Does Reynolds nonetheless provide a voluntary warning? j We did. We put a voluntary nicotine warning on VUSE because it contains nicotine, so we used the -- j basically the California -- the state of California type warning on our VUSE pouchs. Does the warning indicate that VUSE contains nicotine and nicotine is addictive? x \2 o i; Does it also counsel against use of VUSE by pregnant women and others who may be sensitive to nicotine exposure?

Reynolds? j Correct. 'j You were asked some questions by Mr. Gale about whether you consider it safe or not, You made reference to without long term epidemiological, you couldn't quantify the long-term risk. Let me ask you this question: Based on the data that we do have, the chemistry data that you referred to earlier and Reynolds' safeguards that it has used and any other data of which you're aware, is there anything in your | opinion that would indicate that VUSE has the potential to be more harmful than the traditional | tobacco products? Not that I've seen, no. I've seen just the opposite. Let's talk about what does the data -- What does the date suggest to you as the potential for VUSE to be less risky than traditional tobacco products? I mean, I think it has a very high potential of doing that. I mean, looking at the aerosol chemistry, very difficult to find anything in there, and it's hard to -- you know, when the levels get so low that you have to change all your methodology to try to get down even further to try to find stuff, you know you're -- I think you know you're heading in the right direction. That's where we are with VUSE. We 2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING 1. studied it using conventional cigarette methodologies and we cannot find toxicants and carcinogens at sufficient enough quantity to be above detection limits. That doesn't mean they're not necessarily there, but they're at much lower levels.

"Can you just briefly remind us the migration strategy .*..v,.r:jand where #y.utth.ink,,y.USE and the other products that R'eynolds has fit into that strategy compared to conventional tobacco burning cigarettes?","Well, I mean, I think that conventional tobacco burning cigarettes are the most risky.

Although it's not definitively proven, we do know that it produces lower exposures of carcinogens and toxicants to smokers who use them, so it's probably lower in risk. Certainly, it's well known, at least well known to the public health community, that all smokeless tobacco products are significantly lower in risk than smoking cigarettes, even though tobacco consumers don't necessarily know that, but they are significantly lower in risk. So all of our smokeless products, including Snus and moist snuff, would be lower on the risk continuum. Then, it's hard to say.' I think I would argue to put -- until we know better -- VUSE is either somewhere around the smokeless products -- it could be a lot lower, unlikely to be higher -- but, you are inhaling an aerosol, so I don't know if that may not have longer term effects, but certainly I would say it's going to be -- likely to be much lower than burning cigarettes. Then finally you would have nicotine replacement therapies, I think as low on the risk continuum next to quitting, and of course NRT's would include things like Zonnic gum that we make and 5 Nivonovum. ;i:i, i .fl , ifl^j|),i , i | i j j j ,j,i .^^ 3RD AVENUE NORTH BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 ro Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING"

So it's a hard nut to crack, really. It's a difficult proposition to get right, and to my mind, it hasn't been gotten right yet.",
"When these cigarettes, denicotinized or very, very low nicotine yielding cigarettes, were poured on the market, did the public health community jump onboard and encourage smokers to switch to one that was going to be better' for them?","No, it was quite the opposite. In fact, I think when Philip Morris came out with their de-nic products in the early, early 90's, Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids, Matt Myers -- or he may not have been with them at that point -- but, Matt Myers came out and basically proclaimed that would be one of the most dangerous cigarettes on the whole market that's ever been made. So the public health community has a very unusual way of changing its mind over time and how it views thing.

"And getting back to the FDA for a moment, does the FDA have the authority to adopt a product standard and set a level for nicotine in the cigarettes?",They do.
Have they done that yet?,"It just can't be zero, but they have not done that. Q, Doctor, do you want to keep going or do you want to take a break for a minute? Everybody okay?"

Oh, sure, \ Reynolds memos and other things, had letterheads on them, RJR letterheads? \ Absolutely. j You mentioned RDM and RDR, what are those? \ RDM is a research RD memo, RDR is a research report, \ just the acronym for memorandum and reports that - -> *> <f .;,- would go to the library for completion of projects j :j and things like that.

[ And I guess as part of that formal structure, formal research development reports, RDR's, and formal research department memorandums, RDM's, copies of those would be provided to the Reynolds library? Do you see anywhere on here that this indicates it is 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING Pagc276 an RDR or an RDM? No, it is not indicated anywhere that that's what that would be. I may be stretching your memory a bit, but do you remember what the format of RDR's and RDM's in terms of what it looked like on the first page and any designations that would indicate what they were? Yeah, you had a specific, almost like a formula on how you would lay it out. You would have,your RDR or RDM number, you had a project number, you had an author, you had a title of what the project was, so yeah, it was formulaic in terms of how these reports were issued to the library. For RDM's and RDR's, was there an approval system and an area of the document that had an approval by the person's manager before it would be submitted to the library? There was, yes. Do you see whether there is any approval line or any signature by Dr. league's supervisor or manager approving this memo? There is not. Let's talk about some of the designs here that are reflected, I guess, on page 17. You were asked some questions -- I'll do it in order. You were asked 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING about this clean chewing tobacco and asked if that's Snus. Remind us how long has Snus as a tobacco product been in existence?",A couple of hundred years.
Who was the first U.S. tobacco company to bring Snus to the U.S. market?,"Modern Snus, it would be either R.J. Reynolds or you might say it was Swedish Match, but that's hard to know, I think Swedish Match was -- that was Swedish Snus in the U.S. market."
"Among the major cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris, Lorillard when they were separate at the time, and others, who was the first cigarette manufacturer to bring Snus to the U.S. market?",Reynolds.
Why did Reynolds bring Snus to the U.S. market; what was the reasoning?,"Because of the lower risk potential for Snus and it was known that Swedish style Snus had accomplished quite a bit in Sweden in terms of lung cancer rates among men, lowest lung cancer rates in all of Europe, largely attributable to the fact that most men in Sweden had switched from using cigarettes to using Snus."
"Was Snus introduced -- developed and introduced by 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING 'i Pagc278 | Reynolds as part of its migration strategy?

No. Things like a lithium-ion battery and a microprocessor and having the ability to communicate l back and forth, did that technology exist in the | 60's? No. That's enough on that one. You were asked some questions about document retention and you made the point that it wouldn't surprise you if Reynolds had destroyed documents. To be candid with you, doctor, that sounds sinister.

If you went down to the R&D library today, could you ask for a copy of some RDM from the 1950's? You can, yes, and we routinely do. You were asked some questions about the depository in Minnesota and can you quantify for us, to the best of \ your memory, either the number of documents or number of pages that Reynolds has produced from its own files to the depository? They're -- I can't remember the exact number, but there are several million documents that have been -- i just from Reynolds that have been put into the | repository, which consists of tens of millions of | pages, so there is a lot of documents that are in the depository. In addition to being in the depository -- who can access the depository? Anybody. In addition to the repository, are Reynolds documents that it's produced in litigation, millions of j documents, tens of millions of pages, are they also | available online? 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 m Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING They are. Who has access to those documents? Anybody who wishes it. It's open to the public. Is there a search engine or an ability to identify documents? There is, yes. What are some of the fields if you want to find Claude Teague's '69 document? You could go -- there's an author field, there's a subject field, so a number of fields you can use to help search and narrow down. And the depository and the internet website came about as part -- I believe you testified as part of the master settlement agreement? Correct. Was that agreement forced upon Reynolds or was that a voluntary? Well, it's a voluntary agreement, right? I mean, it's an agreement between two parties. Negotiations occurred and terms were met. Going back to the document and document destruction issue, did -- and I believe you invited Mr. Gale to do this, but did he show you any documents with respect to allegations of document destruction so you could comment or give your opinion on that? 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 ^ Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING o No, he d id n o t . The gentleman's agreement, you were asked some questions about the gentleman's agreement and I believe you said, testified, that your awareness of that comes from being asked questions by plaintiff's lawyers in situations like this? Correct, yes. Did Mr, Gale show you any documents that talked about something called a gentleman's agreement? I did not see any. Remind us of what your understanding of what this alleged gentleman's agreement would be, or what it prohibited or what the companies agreed to? In theory, from my understanding, as its' been explained to me, is no biological research would occur on cigarettes or health related research around cigarettes. And, as I explained, if there was such an agreement, R.J. Reynolds broke it probably from day one, because they were doing biological research from the 60's to today. And you provided Mr. Gale a reliance list. Do you know if that reliance list contains Reynolds' research on biological research going back to the 60?s and forward up to more recent times, including biological research with animals, biological research 3RD AVENUE NORTH-BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 -205-397-2397 g CM k / Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING .10",.

"Again, doctor, if I'm stretching your memory, tell me, but if you recall this information, please do so. Do you know in this time, January of '54, if there were distinguished authorities outside of the tobacco companies who were pointing out that it hadn't been proven that cigarette smoking was one of the causes?","Oh, yeah. I mean, the NCI did not agree. The NCI didn't believe that it was one of the causes at that time. There was a number of distinguished authorities that questioned whether or not the statics were enough to establish that and many outright said it wasn't possible."
"Number one under this distinguished authorities point out -- we were reading number three, but number one says that medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer. Was that an accurate statement at the time, in January of '54?","Oh, it was at the time and it is today as well."

We talked a lot about modifications that had been done to cigarettes, general reduction, filters, reconstituted tobacco, j etcetera. Was Reynolds R&D into the implementation of those kinds of things? How does that relate to j the maintaining the interest of public health? I think it's a direct correlation. I think you told us that the epidemiology again suggests to you that there -- that filtered cigarettes carry less risk than non filtered. So if j Reynolds didn't have concern about public health and cigarettes were just like they were, non filtered, in the 50's, would we have seen this reduction in risk for consumers if they never existed? Obviously not. j We talked earlier about the industry involving the \ National Cancer Institute and Tobacco Working Group.

And the operating premise, simply put, was if there are -- the operating premise was even if you can't fully establish that smoking is a direct cause, that you can't make a causal connection, if there are things in smoke that are of concern, it would be best to minimize them. Certainly, that operating premise was executed by Reynolds scientists and by their product development efforts over the next 60 years."
"We'll come back to that in a second, but with respect to Reynolds' participation in the NCI Tobacco Working Group, was that voluntary? Did Reynolds have to participate in that program?","No, they were asked if they would like to participate and they agreed Reynolds agreed."
"Then with respect to implementing the operating premise, let me ask you this question: Did Reynolds' position on whether smoking was proven to be a causative disease get in the way whatsoever with the research that it conducted trying to address the criticisms that were being levered against the product?","No, that research continued. 4lvlWKI!TO?|!ff!i^ 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING H jrl < r\ * r\ .

Certainly, we have funded l an awful lot of public health community research, certainly we participated in.NCI-TWG, so I -- Having a scientific disagreement is not a demonstration of being uncooperative in my opinion."
"But, if the public health community asked R.J, Reynolds for its research and reports on smoking health in the 60 fs, did R.J. Reynolds provide that in a useable fashion to the public health community?",.
"If you would have authenticated documents in the Duval County depo, that would still be applicable today, correct?",Yes.
That's all the questions I have.,
"Dr. Figler, just a couple of follow ups on what you were just asked about, then we'll get you out of here. You were asked about advertising for lights, low tar type cigarettes. Have you ever been shown an ad or seen an ad that you recall in which one of the cigarette manufacturers advertised that, in fact, lights or low tar cigarettes were safer?","Not that I know of, no."

"What -- As concisely as you can, doctor, what was the basis of the FDA ordering that Reynolds remove those four brands from the market, specifically in relation to whether they made, any assessments about the dangers or addictiveness of those products and the reason to take them off?","They didn't make any assessment about the dangers or addictiveness of the product. They made an assessment about whether the product that we were comparing it to was substantially equivalent. And the products we chose to compare those products to, to grandfathered products, were -- the FDA deemed that they were not substantially equivalent. So, let's really go back to the drawing board and figure out what your predicates ought to be and make better arguments and better -- present better information to the FDA so they can see it the same or similar way as we do. We thought the products were substantial equivalent."
