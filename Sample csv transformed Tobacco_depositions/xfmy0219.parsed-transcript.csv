question,answer,Declarative_Text
"Good morning, Mr. Wilson. Could you please state your current position.","Yes. I am director of regulatory 0 affairs, engagement, and communications for Altria Client Services."
"Within that position, do you provide services to Philip Morris USA?","Yes, I do. 5 Q. How long have you held your current http://www.phippsreporting.com position as director of regulatory affairs, engagement, and communications?"
"You described your responsibilities in that position to some extent in your earlier testimony, but just so the record is clear, could you please describe your job responsibilities since November 2009 as the director of regulatory affairs, engagement, and communications?","Sure. In a general sense, starting back in 2009, I held the regulatory affairs function and group for Altria Client Services to support our regulated tobacco operating companies. I worked with and continue to work with people inside the company to help them understand the FDA's regulatory requirements and what the law says and help to communicate about that internally, help to build training and education about that internally, and then I work closely with and interact with the Food and Drug Administration itself to provide them information and to meet with them and to kind of work with them as they implement the regulatory authority."
"You mentioned the FDA implementing its http://www.phippsreporting.com regulatory authority. Does the FDA regulate the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris USA?","Yes, it does."
How long has the FDA regulated Philip Morris USA?,"The law that granted the Food and Drug Administration that authority went into effect in June of 2009. So since the summer of 2009, FDA has had the authority to regulate tobacco products, including Philip Morris USA."
What is the name of that law?,It is the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.
What areas of Philip Morris USA's business does the FDA regulate?,"Well, it really regulates all aspects of Philip Morris's business from the products itself and how they are manufactured to how the products -- what we can say about the products, and even how the products themselves are sold."
"With regard to the first area, the products and how they are manufactured, can you 3 describe what the FDA has done in its regulation of Philip Morris's products, Philip Morris USA's products and how they are manufactured? http://www.phippsreporting.com","Sure. There are a number of things, but I can give you some examples. So FDA required the companies, including Philip Morris, to register all of its manufacturing centers and provide a list of all the products that it manufacturers and sells and distributes, required that companies provide extensive ingredient information, established a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents and required testing and reporting of those constituents. And in the manufacturing world specifically, they have the authority and have conducted inspections."
"With regard to the second area that you mentioned, which I believe you said was what Philip Morris can say about its products, what has the FDA done to regulate Philip Morris USA's marketing of its cigarettes?","So they have implemented a number of 0 things that maybe a good example to explain what I'm talking about is that there was a provision in the law that went into effect in 2010 that required the removal of descriptors, words that previously were on cigarette packs like low, mild, medium, so forth. Those were required to be removed. http://www.phippsreporting.com And FDA, it has authority over statements the company makes if it were to make some kind of a claim about a product, it would need FDA's authorization to be able to do that."
"And as to the third area of Philip Morris USA's business that the FDA regulates, what has the FDA done to regulate how Philip Morris USA cigarettes are sold?","Again, there are a couple of examples that come to mind for that. One requirement that was in the law that's been implemented was that all tobacco products need to be sold in a clerk-assisted manner, which sometimes is referred to in a non-self-service manner, so, in other words, for a consumer that wants to purchase it, they need to ask a clerk to actually get the product and provide it to them for the transaction. So that went into place. And FDA has also developed they have entered into contracts with state officials to conduct inspections at retail to ensure that products are being sold to adults and that they are not being sold to youth. And they have retailer enforcement actions that they follow to conduct those inspections and assess compliance with the law at retail. http://www.phippsreporting.com"
"Now, in addition to the areas that you have already described, can the FDA also require Philip Morris USA to provide the FDA information about its business?","Yes, it can."
What types of information?,"Really they can ask for any type of information that they think is important. They can ask for detailed information about the products themselves, you know, beyond the things I have already mentioned- They can ask for documents, if they have a particular topic that they are interested in, so, for example, if they ask for tobacco and health-related documents that the companies had. So they really have the ability to ask for information across any of the areas that they have regulatory authority that I described."
You mentioned inspections. Does the FDA have authority to conduct inspections of Philip Morris USA's facilities?,"They do. They have, they have the authority to do it. In fact, they are actually required to conduct inspections at least once every two-year cycle. They have already -- they have http://www.phippsreporting.com already conducted inspections. They did the first cycle, and they are on their second cycle of actually conducting inspections."
Can you please describe what happens when the FDA inspects one of Philip Morris USA's facilities in general terms?,"Sure. In a general sense, there are unannounced inspections, meaning that the FDA literally just decides to show up at a manufacturing facility and they have done this at Philip Morris's facility is where they show up and knock on the door and say we're here and we would like to conduct an inspection. What happens then is that the company obviously brings them in and finds out what they are interested in, what they would like to see, takes them on a tour of the manufacturing facility, answers questions that they may have, provides documentation if they are looking for documentation. So it really gives FDA the full access to the manufacturing facility and to the leadership at the manufacturing facility to, again, take them on a tour and answer questions that provide information. 4 Q. Is the FDA also authorized to collect information from Philip Morris USA about the http://www.phippsreporting.com ingredients in its cigarettes?"
Did Congress give the FDA authority to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act if one of the tobacco companies isn't complying with the law?,"It did. FDA actually has fairly extensive enforcement authorities as well, so, for example, if during the course of an inspection of any manufacturing facility, if FDA determined that there was some particular problem or something that was a significant concern to them, they could, they could shut down a manufacturing facility right there on the spot. And it would remain closed until FDA determined it could be reopened. They have the ability to order you to stop selling a product, if they have a basis for, for doing that and believing that it shouldn't be in the marketplace. They can order a product to be seized and destroyed. They can impose fines and penalties, so they have a variety of enforcement methods. 4 Q. Where does the money come from to fund the FDA's regulation of the tobacco industry? http://www.phippsreporting.com"
Are tax dollars used to fund the FDA's regulation of the tobacco industry in any way?,No.
One final area with respect to the FDA. Did Philip Morris USA support Congress's efforts to give the FDA authority to regulate the tobacco industry?,"Yes. We did, actually, support that for quite a number of years. I think I made mention of this in the earlier testimony, but in the year 2000, the company announced its support for FDA regulation and then worked actively over the course of the eight and a half, almost nine years until it passed Congress to encourage Congress to actually enact that law. 4 Q. Does the FDA regulate what goes into Philip Morris USA cigarettes? http://www.phippsreporting.com"
Does the FDA regulate what comes out of Philip Morris USA's cigarettes?,
Does the FDA regulate what Philip Morris USA can say in its marketing materials and on its packs about its cigarettes?,"Yes, it does."
"Mr. Wilson, you started out by saying http://www.phippsreporting.com that in your present position that you helped build the Regulatory Affairs Department of, I guess it would be Altria Client Services, correct?","Yes, that is what I said, yes."
And tell me what you did to build the Regulatory Affairs Department?,"Sure. In a general sense, at the beginning we identified what the -- working with others internally, identified what the new requirements of the law were back in 2009 and what kind of work we needed to do and work we needed to help Philip Morris do in order to comply with the law. And then over time continued to add, you know, people to do that work, generally brought in from other parts of the company who were doing similar work, and over time when I joined the group, I think I was the third person to join the Regulatory Affairs Group. And then over time as we, you know, learned and identified what work needed to be done, we built that out, you know, kind of like you would do any other department in a company to identify the people that we needed and the types of skill sets that we needed and things like that. http://www.phippsreporting.com to review 2014? testimony extent you with any privileged By the way, did you have the opportunity your deposition transcript from June 19, Yes, I did. Did you meet with anyone to discuss the you gave on June 19th, 2014?"
"I'm simply asking you, sir, whether you have ever been asked the types of questions that you were asked today before today?",
"Have you before today, Mr. Wilson, ever had the occasion to describe what in general you do and your position with regulatory affairs?",
You said that you helped build the Regulatory Affairs Department. Was that a new department?,"Yes, it was. The company had, prior to the enactment of this law, had other regulatory compliance obligations that were handled, you know, in other parts of the company, but when this law passed specifically in 2009, we formed the Regulatory Affairs Department that I was referring to. So in essence it was, it was really a new 4 department, yes. 5 Q. What other areas of the company, and http://www.phippsreporting.com L let's go first to Philip Morris USA, had other regulatory affairs departments?"
"Well, who had the responsibility for Philip Morris before you helped form the Regulatory Affairs Department?","Again, it depends on what point in time that we're talking about. You might recall that we talked about the, I think we talked earlier about the changes to the corporate structure and the creation of Altria Client Services as a service-providing company. So let me just speak about during that http://www.phippsreporting.com time frame. As an example, prior to the formation of the current Regulatory Affairs Department that I was referencing, some of our state reporting and other federal reporting responsibilities were managed out of the Research, Development and Engineering, RD&E Department, in Altria Client Services."
The Research and Development handled the regulatory affairs at Altria Client Services before you formed the new Regulatory Affairs Department as a result of the passage of the -- I am just going to call it the Act -- Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; is that accurate?,
"When it comes to regulatory affairs before you formed the Regulatory Affairs Department to deal in essence with the FDA, who at Philip Morris USA or Altria Client Services dealt with marketing issues?","I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean by ""marketing issues."""
"Well, I mean the same thing you meant when you talked about marketing in responding to Mr. Snapp's question and talked about removal of descriptors. Do you r e c a l l j u s t us ing the term ""marketing""?","Yes. The, the examples I was providing in response to the question that was asked earlier by Mr. Snapp was about work that was done after the Regulatory Affairs Group was created that I referenced. So I j u s t wanted to be c l e a r . You were http://www.phippsreporting.com asking me, I believe, a question about before the Regulatory Affairs Group was created, and I wanted to make sure I understood what you were asking."
"Well, I am talking about marketing. Who before your department was created handled marketing regulatory affairs?","There was a department called Marketing Compliance that prior to the enactment of the FDA law handled marketing compliance-related issues; for example, related to the tobacco settlement agreements."
"Well, in what department of either Altria Client Services or Philip Morris USA was the department or whatever you want to call it that handled marketing regulatory affairs?","If I understand your question, the marketing, the Marketing Compliance Group that I just mentioned a moment ago, I believe was a part of the Marketing Department itself, if that's what you are asking me."
And that would be the Marketing Department of Altria Client Services or Philip 3 Morris USA?,"Just to be clear, again, that changed over time. It was inside of Philip Morris USA. And http://www.phippsreporting.com then with the corporate changes and restructuring that took place in approximately the 2008 time frame, I believe that that's when the Marketing Compliance Group moved into to an Altria Client Services role, where it had been in Philip Morris USA prior to that."
"You said in connection with helping to build a Regulatory Affairs Department that you also helped train people internally with respect to the FDA and the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, correct?",Yes.
"Now, please tell me who all you trained.","Well, there have been a number of different efforts over the years, but there have been some communications that have gone out to all employees. There have been others that have been developed to, you know, kind of focus in specific areas, you know, such as manufacturing. So it really kind of depended over time. But my point, I guess, was that there was, you know, interactions with people throughout the company over the last couple of years about the FDA requirements. At the beginning it was helping people understand the new law that was enacted and a http://www.phippsreporting.com L general overview of what was included in that law and so forth. And then over time, you know, it has depended on the particular topic. There have been more specific, you know, interactions with various groups of employees, again, over time, depending on the specific topic."
"Did you have the occasion, Mr. Wilson, to meet with the top management executives of either Altria or Philip Morris USA to explain to them and train them with respect to the requirements of the law?","Well, I certainly have interacted with the senior management of Altria and Philip Morris USA over these years. Those individuals, I think, generally were well familiar with the requirements and provisions. What I was describing was more kind of the broad-based employees who would have been less familiar because perhaps they hadn't really been as closely involved during the course of those eight and a half years that we were, you know, encouraging Congress to pass that law. 4 Q. You said that excuse me -- you, you being Philip Morris USA, began to support regulation http://www.phippsreporting.com by the FDA in the year 2000, correct?"
Why did Philip Morris USA begin to support regulation by the Food and Drug Administration beginning in 2000?,"The company believed that it was appropriate and a good idea for FDA cr some government agency, Federal Government agency, but with FDA being kind of an obvious choice, to have regulatory authority over tobacco products and to ensure that there was a common set of standards by which all manufacturers would need to comply, you know, common set of standards and consistent approaches. The company also believed that it was, you know, an appropriate role for the federal regulatory agency to determine and support the idea of clear and consistent communications about tobacco products and also to have the regulatory authority to determine, you know, whether or not any particular tobacco product may be a modified risk or a less harmful tobacco product. 3 And for all of those reasons, we thought it was appropriate that there be a Federal 5 Government agency to have the authority to do all of http://www.phippsreporting.com that work and to make those decisions."
"And it was the belief of Philip Morris USA that the proper agency to do that would be the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, right?","Yes, generally that's what the company believed. I suppose --"
"Now, what ~~ why was it that Philip Morris USA believed that that particular agency should undertake this regulatory task of the tobacco industry?",Okay.
"All right, sir?",Thank you.
"Why did Philip Morris believe in calendar year 2000 that the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, would be the proper agency to regulate the cigarette industry?","I wasn't involved in those decisions in 2000, so I can't answer definitively. I can give you my personal perspective, just, you know, kind of thinking back to that time frame. In a general sense, it is largely because it is kind of comparable to what the FDA does for other products. I mean, they have fairly broad regulatory authority to do the kinds of things I was describing for tobacco products, for food products, and medical devices and drugs and so forth. So in some respects, the way that I think about it was it was, you know, consistent with FDA's authority and approach on other products."
"Okay. So basically I guess we could agree that of all the agencies, federal agencies out 4 there, the FDA would be the obvious choice, right?","Again, from a personal perspective, it http://www.phippsreporting.com seemed logical to me at the time and still does."
"And you have been involved in the public affairs area for Philip Morris USA and Altria Client Services, correct?",Yes.
"And in connection with that, you are used to fielding questions and answering questions concerning the various positions that Philip Morris USA and/or Altria Client Services or the Altria group has taken with respect to policy issues, are you not?",
"Yeah, and provide provide statements as to the company's position on various matters, 2 correct?","Yes. 4 Q. And to be able to do that, you have to 5 know not only what is going on within the company at http://www.phippsreporting.com the current time, you have to know what has gone on within the company in the past, correct?"
All right. I'm sorry.,"No, I am done."
"Now, you are aware that during this eight and a half years when enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was pending before Congress that that was not the first time that there was consideration of the FDA regulating cigarette companies, correct?",
"It is true, is it not, sir, that Philip Morris USA strenuously opposed FDA regulation of its business, didn't it?",
"Well, you said that there was a time when the FDA was trying to regulate the cigarette industry. Is that the time you are thinking about?","Yes. And so I can answer your question about, about that, which is, yes, the company was opposed to that effort back at that time frame in the mid-1990s because it was, you know, as I understand it, a very different approach to regulation in at least a couple of ways. One of them was that Congress didn't 0 grant FDA that authority, it didn't deliberate and pass a law that provided FDA that authority first. And then, secondly, I believe that that attempt back in the 1990s was to regulate tobacco products to a medical device standard as opposed to, you know, for an agricultural -based product that they are. http://www.phippsreporting.com And so the support in 2000 was based on developing a regulation that's appropriate for tobacco products as agricultural-based products and doing that through the congressional processes."
"Was there consideration by Philip Morris USA back in the mid-1990s that it should cooperate closely with the FDA and a few houses of Congress so that efforts could be made to provide this regulation which you now say, as I understand it, is a good thing?",
"Isn't it a fact, Mr. Wilson, that at 4 least one of the major factors that drove Philip Morris USA to come out in support of federal http://www.phippsreporting.com regulation by the FDA of the cigarette industry in the year 2000 was that it was trying to repair its considerably damaged credibility with congressmen, senators, state legislative officials, and the general public?",
"You are aware, are you not, Mr. Wilson, that in April of 1994 the CEO, the top person at Philip Morris USA, appeared before a subcommittee of Congress chaired by Congressman Waxman and under oath said that he did not believe that nicotine in cigarettes or cigarettes are addictive? You are aware of that, are you not?",
"Let me reask my question. You are aware that the chief executive officer of Philip Morris USA appeared before a subcommittee of the United States Congress in April of 1994 and testified under oath about two things; one thing being that cigarettes are not addictive, you are aware of that, are you not?",
"Well, you were aware of it, right?",
"Let's quit dancing. I know you weren't with the company until 1999. But you were aware that your head man, chief executive officer, appeared before Congress, raised his right hand to the almighty and swore under oath that cigarettes were not addictive? You of aware of that, right?",
"Yeah. Well, there is not much specifics to it. And he also swore under oath that he didn't know smoking cigarettes had anything to do with causing lung cancer. You are aware of that in a 3 general sense, right?",
"My question asked you, did it not, sir, any general sense. You are aware that your chief executive officer swore to those two things, correct?",
"Mr. Wilson, would you please tell me and tell this Court and tell this jury why you persist in going way beyond the specific question I ask you in your answer?",
"Would you be willing, sir, if I ask you very specific questions to attempt to simply answer as concisely as you can my question without going into other areas?",Is that -- I am trying to answer your / ejussuions. An>-4 in SOITLG cas6s I just x^slicvs unSu there is some context that is necessary to completely answer the question.
"Well, your attorney, Erik Snapp, is an excellent attorney. And if he feels he needs to follow up, he will bring out other things, which is his function. Have you taken the, the PM course 101, 102, and 103, by the way?","I'm sorry, I don't know what you are referencing."
"Have you received any training at Philip Morris or Altria Client Services about being a spokesperson with the media or, you know, the public organizations, things of that nature in your public affairs government relations work?",
Did you receive any training in that regard anywhere else?,
"Back to 1994, you are aware in a general sense, although you were not with the company, Philip Morris USA at the time that in April 1994 the chief executive officer of Philip Morris swore under oath to a subcommittee of the United States Congress that he did not believe that smoking cigarettes was addictive. True?",
"And you are also aware, are you not, sir, 4 in a general sense, again understanding that you were not with the company, you had not read any http://www.phippsreporting.com transcript, you were generally aware that the same chief executive officer of Philip Morris testified under oath before a subcommittee of the United States Congress that he did not believe that smoking cigarettes caused lung cancer. True?",
"By the way, have you ever seen the video clips of that testimony?",
"All right. Now, at the same time that 0 this was going on in the mid-1990s, Philip Morris USA was involved in various litigation around the 2 country with respect to smoking and health and addiction issues, was it not?",
"Well, you are aware, are you not, that it was during that time frame from, let's just pick 1994 on up to the end of the 1990s that for the first time Philip Morris USA was required to produce previously secret internal company documents with respect to the subject of smoking and health and addiction, correct?",
"Well, it created the website to post those documents after it was required to by the Master Settlement Agreement, was it not?",
"Yeah. Philip Morris resolved lawsuits by four separate states and then it resolved a lawsuit with a Master Settlement Agreement with the remaining 50 states of the United States, correct?",
"And as part of that, as you have said, it had to set up a website and put those heretofore secret internal documents on a website, correct?",
"Would you agree with me, sir, when all of these documents and the knowledge of Philip Morris USA, as well as the other cigarette manufacturers, came to the public's attention and to the attention of the Congress of the United States there was outrage?",
"Well, are you aware of any other hearings 0 at which the chief executive officers of the cigarette companies appeared before Congress in 1998?",
So you are not aware of Mr. Bible appearing before the United States Congress in 1998?,
"Is it your testimony that from 1999, I believe you joined in October at the same time as the rollout of the Philip Morris USA website. And I'm not talking about the one where they were forced to put the documents on-line, but Philip Morris rolled out its own website, correct?",
In its original --in its original website.,
"Now, in October of 1999 Philip Morris did not state in its own words that it, Philip Morris USA, agrees that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, correct?",
"That wasn't my question, sir. Simple question: Philip Morris USA didn't say we agree that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, did it?",
"Now, Mr. Wilson, you weren't there when this website and its language was designed, so to speak, were you?",
"Is there a reason, sir, that in answer to some of my questions you quickly point out that you weren't with the company at that time while in answer to other questions, which include a period of time that you were not with the company, you start discussing what the intent of the company was?",
Why the difference?,
"Who did you talk to that told you that they believed is that they, they being Philip Morris 3 USA, thought they were conveying that Philip Morris 4 USA agrees or states for the first time that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and other disease? http://www.phippsreporting.com Who told you that they thought that they did that?",
"Who was it that told you that they thought that they had communicated in the original launch of the website that we at Philip Morris USA agree that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, emphysema, and I forget all the other things and other diseases. Who told you that they thought they had done that?",
Who was the head of corporate affairs at that time?,"It was Ellen Merlo. 4 Q. How many sets of eyes do you think looked 5 at what Philip Morris USA had to say about smoking http://www.phippsreporting.com and health, and we might as well throw in addiction, before the original launch of Philip Morris's website in October of 1999?"
"How many drafts did they go through, do you know that, on either one of those messages, smoking and health and disease causation and smoking causing addiction? Any idea how many drafts they went through?",
"Any idea whether or not they had focus groups to run the particular language past so that they could gauge what people thought it meant? 0 A. No, I don't know.",
Did you folks do that when you made changes to the website as the years went on?,
"Now, there were some other things going on in calendar year 2000 when Philip Morris USA came out in support of federal regulation of the cigarette industry, and one of those things was the whole issue about tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes, correct?",
"Well, do you remember that you told Mr. Snapp about how the FDA had the authority and, you know, to get involved in marketing and you mentioned 4 removal of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights, mild, that sort of thing? http://Cd.il http://Li.ld.i_ http://www.phipps","Yes, I recall, I recall saying that."
"Now, it is true, is it not, sir, that 3 Philip Morris USA at the time of calendar year had the leading low tar brand of cigarettes; is that not true?",
"Low tar, light?",
"But that's you said earlier that that's one of the things that Philip Morris USA 0 wanted to accomplish was to have federal regulations so that the entire industry would be regulated by 2 the same standards, correct?","Yes, I did say that. 4 Q. And so that the entire industry would be 5 regulated as to what could be said about their http://www.phippsreporting.com particular brands of cigarettes such as low tar cigarettes, correct?"
"Well, at that point in time, I am correct, am I not, sir, that Philip Morris USA and the Federal Trade Commission still reported the tar and nicotine content of domestic cigarettes, correct?",
"Mr. Wilson, you said something about there having been changes to Philip Morris USA' s website after its initial launch in 1999. Correct?","Yes, I did. And the website has obviously changed a lot over the years, just as websites generally do."
"Now, can you tell me after its initial launch in 1999 the first time that the change was made to Philip Morris USA1s website concerning its position and statements about smoking being a cause of lung cancer and other diseases?",
Can you give me an approximate idea? Are we talking about the first several years of 2000s? Mid-2000?,
And in essence did Philip Morris USA for the first time at that point state in its own words that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer or 3 emphysema and other diseases?,
"Did they also state for the first time after the initial launch of the website, did they also state that we agree that smoking cigarettes is addictive?",
"Now, you talked about the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and how the FDA could get involved with marketing such as removal of descriptors on cigarette packets, cartons, and in advertising such as lights, ultra lights, low tar, lower tar. Do you recall talking about that? 3 MR. SNAPP: Object to the form.",
Would you agree with me that Philip Morris USA and then Altria Group fought that to the bitter end?,
"Yes, sir.","No, it was a provision that was in the law. We supported that, the passage of that law for a very long time, including that provision, and then implemented those changes in 2010."
"You are saying that Philip Morris or Altria Group while supporting passage of the law did not say it opposed and disagreed with the removal of descriptors such as lights, lowered tar?",
"Philip Morris USA did not remove descriptors such as lights, ultra lights from its various cigarette brands until it was required to. True?",
"You stated or talked about how the FDA requires that Philip Morris USA provides a list of all of its products, all of its ingredients, and that it provide a list of any harmful constituents in its cigarettes. Do you recall saying that?",
Has Philip Morris USA or Altria Group complied with that group?,"Yes. And just, again, to be precise, Altria Client Services provides that kind of support on behalf of Philip Morris USA, so Philip Morris USA satisfies its compliance requirements with the help of Altria Client Services, but, yes, we, we met all of those compliance requirements."
"And in its reporting, it is reporting in its cigarettes, as we all sit here today, there are carcinogens, tobacco-specific nitrosamines and other harmful constituents in the smoke of its cigarettes. True?",
And -- and? It is all right. You can say it.,
"Every single cigarette as of today of Philip Morris USA has carcinogens, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and other harmful constituents in it, true?",
"Harmful constituents, harmful to human beings, correct? http://www.phippsreport",
"And that's one of the reasons why Philip Morris USA way back when decided that it wants federal regulations of the cigarette industry, its industry, right?",
"Well, Mr. Wilson, the FDA isn't making billions of dollars every year selling cigarettes.",
"Philip Morris USA is, correct?",
"And as evidenced by just what you had to say, Philip Morris USA now wants to take the position, well, this whole problem is now in the lap 4 of the FDA, don't blame us, right?",
Are you doing anything to try to solve the problem of the effect on human beings of smoking your cigarette products?,
"They are in a better position than a manufacturer who has been manufacturing, who has been designing, engineering, and selling its cigarettes for, I guess it would be about a century now, right?",
"With all the money that the entire cigarette industry makes in a year and has made for years and years and years and years, you are telling me that the cigarette industry couldn't get busy and solve this problem and contact public health authorities and organizations and scientific institutions, it has to be the FDA that does that?",
"You made the statement, sir, that the FDA regulates what goes into a cigarette and what comes out of your cigarettes. Right?",Yes.
"So now this whole thing has been thrown into the lap of the Food and Drug Administration and Philip Morris USA no longer bears any responsibility for what comes into the filters of its cigarettes, into the mouth of smokers of those cigarettes, and sucked deep into the lungs of those smokers, right?",
