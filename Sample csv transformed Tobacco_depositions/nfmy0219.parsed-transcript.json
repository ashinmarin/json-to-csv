You know, if a kid can't get cigarettes even if they try one or two cigarettes from a friend, if they can't buy them and don't have a steady supply, they don't go on to become a smoker. So I say those are the ones that really are at the top of the list.

So like Marlboro has, in the brand organization Marlboro has people who are dedicated to working on Marlboro. And they are the group that coordinate the efforts of the company for Marlboro. And they oversee what goes into the marketplace on behalf of Marlboro. So the Marketing Research Department helps support the brand group so that when they put something in the market we've already gotten feedback from consumers.

And when they study the consumer, they study the consumer by getting feedback on some of the programs that maybe the Marketing Department wants to put in the market. So let's say the Marketing Department wants to change the pack design of one of the brands. They would coordinate with the Marketing Research Department. The Marketing Research Department would write a questionnaire, design a methodology and interview people and maybe show these adult smokers the packs that were under consideration, get that information back and then report back to the Marketing Department. The Marketing Department would be the group that ultimately made the decision on what was going to go in the marketplace and oversaw the programs in the marketplace."

And then, in essence, those are projects where you invite adult smokers to come into a conference room or into a facility or you stop them in a shopping mall. And you screen for eligibility to 5 make sure they're over age and they smoke. And you would speak to them face to face and maybe show them some things that are under consideration. And in other cases where it wasn't an in-person interview, there would be surveys written, people, you know, questionnaires are written to get impressions from consumers about what they like, what they don't like, what they're interested in and to get an understanding of them to develop insights in order to be successful with the programs we put in the market."

So all the research that's done to develop those programs is done with adults. And that's the target audience for Philip Morris brands. So it's what Philip Morris puts into the marketplace that matters. I mean, having knowledge that young people smoke doesn't mean that Philip Morris is going to create programs or initiatives to encourage them to smoke. It's quite the contrary. What Philip Morris does is basically what goes into the marketplace. And if you look at the marketing plans, you can see what goes into the market place and what they sell and how they promote their brands."

You earlier you referenced a couple of different sort of things that 2 market research might be focused on.

Another function or, I guess, role, if you will, that you mentioned was and correct me if I'm wrong, but that market research would look into consumers' reactions to advertising campaigns, promotional materials, things that the company might want to introduce into the marketplace?",
                        "answer": "That would be more consumer research. So within the Marketing Research Department there's a function that's called consumer research, and that was a function I had responsibility for for many years. And that department does quite a diversity of work, but mostly you can bucket into work to help the marketing organization develop what's going into the market. So that, and then they also do some general consumer preference research."

                        "answer": "Sure. Sure. If the company was considering a new advertising campaign for one of its brands or bringing sometimes different executions of an existing campaign, we would convene, invite adult smokers to focus groups and show them some of the materials being considered. Sometimes there might be three or four ad campaigns that the company was considering for a particular brand, so we would show people the campaigns, and everyone we interviewed would be an adult smoker and get their reaction, and then that feedback would go back to the marketing organization. And then they might modify some of the advertising based on that feedback or they might eliminate a couple of the campaigns that were being considered. So it's pretty standard work. It's the same technique for considering the new continuity item or a new package design or a new name for a brand that's going to come into the marketplace."
