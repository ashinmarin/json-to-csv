"Good afternoon, Miss Bonhomme.",Good afternoon. | (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1163 for i.d.) f
"Back on the record. Let me show you a document marked PT1163. We're not going to spend much time with this at all, but I just wanted to look at one point.",Okay. Thank you. I
"And so you're, you know free to, obviously, look at this and review whatever you want, but the only thing I'm going to ask you is sort of follow-up from some questioning we had earlier this morning. 22 A. Okay.",
"But if you look at the top of this document, which I think the date of this is August 15th, 1985.",Yes. j
The subject is trends in smoking...,
The subject is trends in smoking among high school seniors.,Yes.
"And the first paragraph there, it says, ""Historically, about half of all people in all age cohorts who ever smoked have been smokers at age 18."" Do you see that?",I do.
And that's what I was sort of alluding to. This is one source of that information that I was alluding to earlier about the fact that the majority of people who become regular smokers started smoking before the age of 18.,"And I think that's why I answered you the way I did. I was saying there are so many data sources that study the problem of youth smoking and youth smoking rates that I couldn't make a global statement as to smoking rates among young people because depends upon what year, how you measure it and what study. So but if you're asking me is there a study that concludes that, yes, there would be. But you can see this is 1985. I don't know what year you're asking me for and it's there's all sorts of ways to measure it. So but if you're asking me I guess that's what I was trying to explain to you if that makes sense."
"Sure. I understand. I'm sure there are other I'm sure there are data sources or reports where, you know, a slim minority all start smoking by the age of 18 and just like there are other data sources that maybe say like 90 percent of regular smokers began smoking by the age of 18. But what I was trying to get at or what I'm trying to understand is just, you know, in a very general sense the consensus of all of the sources out 0 there that have looked at this issue of when do people begin smoking who become regular smokers, would you agree with me that general, the general consensus is that most people, the majority of people who become 4 regular smokers started smoking before the age of 18?",
Um-hum.,So I will agree with you that too many young people experiment with cigarettes before 18 and they shouldn't.
"Okay. But you're unable to agree, you being \ Philip Morris, Philip Morris is unable to agree that the general consensus across all data sources of organizations or individuals who've looked at this issue of youth smoking conclude that most, majority of regular smokers began smoking before the age of 18?",
Okay. You cannot agree with that statement?,I can not agree with it because it depends j; upon how you classify someone who began smoking. ;
Right. Okay. It I appreciate it.,Yeah. i (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1141 for i.d.) \
Let's look at PT1141.,Another document? j;
"Yes, it is another document.",Okay.
I just I don't want to spend a lot of time on that document. I just want to look at that. In light of our earlier discussion I wanted to look at that piece.,
"What you have there, Miss Bonhomme, is PT1141. It's a June 2nd, 1976 letter from Al Udow to J.J. Morgan. Yes. \ Philip Morris USA inter-office correspondence. As we discussed earlier, J.J. Morgan was head of Marlboro, head of the Marlboro brand? 1976. the Ma VP of he was would Yes, and became the head of marketing around j; Okay. He would have been in a senior capacity over ji rlboro brand. Ij Before then? Or sorry. In when he became marketing? No, I'm saying in 1996 (sic) I don't know if VP or director or what his level was, but he ; have had a, you know, senior capacity over the l Marlboro brand. me see Now let me see. I think you said '96. Let if I can clarify that. Oh, I'm sorry. ; Somewhere around ' 76 . | he became VP of marketing? He became VP of marketing i Okay. in at some point in time. I don't know exactly what year. :",
Gotcha.,"But even if he wasn't vice-president of ji marketing, he was someone who had decision-making ij authority over the Marlboro brand. j:"
Okay. I appreciate it.,Okay.
Thank you. And eventually I think we said he eventually rises to become president of the company?,"Yes, he did. \"
"Okay. The subject of this memo, though, is called Why People Start to Smoke.",Yes. \
"And so this is again, from Al Udow, reading the first paragraph there he says, ""At the end of last week I gave you some material intended to answer Cliff Goldsmith's question on why people start to smoke."" Who is Cliff Goldsmith, do you know?","He was a senior executive of the company l also, and he would have been senior to Jimmy Morgan at \ this time."
Okay. At this time he would have been over or head of Mr. Morgan on the organizational chart?,Yes.
"Gotcha. It says, ""Because we should have this information at our disposal, this document summarizes the data available and cites references."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes. I
"It says, ""There are surprisingly few hard facts on the question of the initiation of smoking. Most of those who write on the subject of smoking tend to rely on the statistical work of Daniel Horn and the National Clearing House For Smoking and Health. Others offer opinions without sources or data to back them up."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes. I
"And then in this memo, which we will not go through in every aspect, but Al Udow goes through and he identifies some of the sources that address this issue of why people begin to smoke?",Yes. I
"I think the first one there is a study by 0 Joseph, is it Matarazzo?","Yeah, I believe so. I"
That was an entry in the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences 1968? 4 A. Yeah. f,
"And then I think there's also let's see what's the next one. There's some stuff from the National was that American Clearing House For Smoking and Health, which organization ran by Daniel Horn? Yes, there's some information. j: And then Harold Diehl, D-i-e-h-1, from the Cancer Society? Yes. \ Encyclopedia Americana, you know, just from the Encyclopedia. Yes, I do. ; Do you see that in there as well? Um-hum. All right. And then there is an organization called the Yankelovich? American Yankelovich. Yankelovich? Yes. Thank you. And they did a study for the Cancer Society doing in-depth interviews with teenagers and young women? Yes. I And their survey or study was basically focused on the teen girls is kind of one of the main focuses of their study?",Yes. \
"So essentially if you look through there and you look at these different reasons, you kind of see some similarities; is that fair?","There's some yes, there's some threads of knowledge, yep."
One of the main things is that they identify that's consistent among why people start smoking is parental smoking?,"Yes, that's a factor."
Right. Having parent or both parents who smoke is definitely a factor in whether someone is going to become a smoker?,"Yes, it's a risk, it's a risk factor."
That's fair. That's a good way to put it. It's a risk factor for that person becoming a smoker?,Yes.
"And depending upon the study, it can either make it, you know, a couple times more likely, two or three more times more likely or even, you know, far 0 more likely than that?","Depending upon the study, yes."
"Okay. In addition to a parent who smokes, having siblings who smoke, like a older sibling is also 4 a risk factor for becoming a smoker?","That's what's learned in this document, yes. you know, And some of the other reasons they give are, peer pressure, obviously, conformity to what's going on with their peers? Yes. Curiosity about smoking habit? Absolutely. Striving for adult status or to be grownup? Yes. And most of this memo is Al Udow sort of quoting block quotes from these other sources? a special continuat Yes, it is. At the end, though, he talks about there study that was done for Philip Morris on ion of smoking. Do you see that? Yes. What page? Page seven if you look at the bottom right-hand corner. Okay. was the The last page, I think, is just bibliography references. Okay. So this is the second to last page. It says, ""Information on the motivation. Do you see that?"
"""Information on the motivation that leads to a continuation of smoking comes from a special study done for Philip Morris (Brand, 1971) ."" Do you see that?",Yes. j
"Who was that Brand? What is that referring to, do you know? Is that like I've seen Roper. Was Brand like an outside market research organization?","Not that I know of no, no. \"
Okay.,But no. I don't believe so. It's not an \ outside organization. I know that.
It's not something you recognize?,I don't know what he's referring to. Okay.
"Okay. And he goes through the, you know, ""Smokers first answered the question of, 'Why do you smoke' with platitudes such as: Gives me something to do with my hands, relieves tension, goes well with a social drink, settles my stomach after a heavy meal, helps me to relax, just an automatic habit, keeps my weight down. But on deeper probing, the circumstances in which smoking occurs may be generalized as follows:"" Number 1, ""As a narcotic, tranquilizer or sedative, smokers regularly use cigarettes at times of stress. Number 2, ""At the beginning or ending of a basic activity. This would cover such activities as entering or leaving a room, starting or finishing a job; going into a party or leaving one, starting a telephone conversation or a personal visit."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"And then Number 3, ""Automatic smoking behavior, heavy smokers particularly light up at intervals without much thought and often without realizing what they are doing. ""It should be noted that there was scarcely any unprompted reference to smoking for taste or flavor until it was suggested. And then everyone agreed that it was the major element to smoking satisfaction."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"Okay. So does the conclusions that Al Udow has about why people smoke that he sort of 0 gleans from these other various sources, is that consistent with what you've seen with regard to Philip Morris's understanding of why people begin to smoke?",
And I appreciate that. And I'm sorry. I'm not trying to cut you off.,Okay.
Were you finished?,Yeah.
"And I get that. More what I was looking at, you know, was as people, children, for example, are predisposed to become smokers if their parents smoke, if their older siblings smoked, would you agree with me that as smoking became more widespread and more parents smoked and more older siblings smoked, that would increase the chances of new smokers, teenagers, children becoming smokers themselves?","Yes. It would advance their the risk of, if a greater percentage of parents smoke, it would advance, increase the risk of their children smoking. (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1074 for i.d.) 0 BY MR. BIGGER:"
"Right. Let me hand you PT1074, 1074. Oh, 2 you've got it.",Got it.
"So I've handed you PT1074, May 21st, 1975?","Yes. let you confirm Philip Morris. I'm sorry. I should have answer that. Go ahead. Oh, I thought you wanted me to say ""yes"" to I did. Sorry. May 21st, 1975 letter. Yes. From Philip Morris excuse me. On Philip Morris inter-office correspondence? Yes. And this is from Myron Johnston to R.B. Seligman? Q- on this Correct. Dr. Seligman was the head of R&D? At one point in time. I don't know exactly date, but, yes. Okay. If I said he was the head of Research and Development 1975, would you correct me, or would you say decline okay? I'd say I believe he was. Okay. Thank you. The subject is, ""The in the rate of growth of Marlboro Red."" You see that subject? Yes."
"Okay. Let's look at this document just for a few minutes. ""I think Dr. Dunn's memo has very effectively dispelled the notion that nicotine reductions have been the cause of the slackening in the rate of growth of Marlboro Red."" Do you see that?",Yes.
We obviously don't have Dr. Dunn's memo. Have you seen Dr. Dunn's memo as referred to in here?,No.
Okay. You didn't see that in preparation for today?,No.
Gotcha. But obviously Dr. Dunn dispelled the notion that nicotine reductions caused the slackening in the rate of growth of Marlboro Red. That's what it says in here?,"That's what it says, yes."
"Gotcha. And so looking down further, Myron Johnston has his contention, which you see right after that, 75, 80 economic forecast?",Yes.
"He says, ""It was my contention that Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among younger smokers and the rapid growth in that population segment. I pointed out that the number of 15 to 19-year-olds is now increasing more slowly and will peak in 1976 and then begin to decline. I also hypothesized that Marlboro would be particularly vulnerable to the recession.""",Yes.
Do you see that?,Yes.
The recession he's referring to is there was a pretty serious national recession that took place in the early 1970s?,"Yes, there was."
"Then he says, ""In my opinion, the decline in Marlboro's growth rate is due to four factors: Number 1 is ""Slower growth in the number of to 19-year-olds."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"Number 2 is ""The recession.""",Yes.
"Number 3 is ""Price increases in 1974.""",Yes.
"And Number 4 is ""Changing brand preferences of younger smokers."" Do you see that? 3 A. Yes.",
"So obviously, you know, qualified within my opinion, Myron Johnston, but two of the four items he identifies deal with younger smokers and in his study 15 to 19-year-olds?",
Do you see that?,"Yes. But you're mischaracterizing it. I | know Myron didn't have a study. Myron was a | demographer, and he used external information, I information that he was able to acquire from either | government agencies or universities to analyze the I marketplace. I"
Right.,So he didn't have a study really. |
"Forgive me. And if I suggested that he did, 0 I apologize. But, yeah, I mean, he obtained data from | other sources and analyzed that data to make these 2 conclusions; is that fair?","To come up with his opinion, yes. He did. | 4 He obtained I 5 Q. His conclusion information from outside the company, you : know, external sources \ up with subject worked, sources Welfare, studies analyze Right. and looked at that information and came j: an analysis and his point of view on that j; And I would say that summarizes the way it ; the way his work was. Well, I mean, for example, one of the was the Department of Health, Education and right? Yes. I They would have done some surveys and some as part of their public health efforts to smoking rates, smoking prevalence amongst different ages and things of that nature. Yes. Okay. And that data was, from the Federal Government was publicly available, right? analyze Yes. And so Mr. Johnston would take that data and ; it in reaching his conclusions that he reports to Dr. Seligman? opinion That's a fair characterization, yes. Okay. And in his opinion and in Myron's based upon the analysis that he did of that publicly available data, the slower growth and the number of total 15 to 19-year-olds, in other words, the, you know, slower growth rate of that size of the population, that segment of the population, is that what he's saying?"
"And the changing brand preferences of younger smokers, so what brands those smokers smoked?","Yes, that's what he's saying."
"Okay. Well, if you look down under demographics there, he says, ""It has been well established by the National Tracking Study and other studies that Marlboro has for many years had its highest market penetration among younger smokers. Most 15 of these studies have been restricted to people aged or and over. But my own data, which includes younger teenagers shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15 to 17-year-olds."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"""The teenage years are also important because those are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke. The years in which initial brand 4 selections are made and the period in the life cycle in which conformity to peer group norms is greatest."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes.
"All right. Let's looking at each of those sort of three things independently, so ""The teenage years are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke,"" do you agree with that conclusion that the teenage years are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke?","Well, that's the same question that you had talked about earlier --"
It is.,"that I I'm not arguing that Myron had data to support that statement in this document. But I wouldn't make that as a broad conclusion about the cigarette marketplace, because you would need to understand -- it's quite complex, much more complex than this one sentence makes it out to be. An example I will give you, many young people might try their first cigarettes at a very cigarette at a very young age and may never smoke again for four, five years. So some try a cigarette and quit. Some try cigarettes and go on to become smokers. So it's really a very complicated issue. So right now I can't say on behalf of the company. I would have to have data. And I would it would have to be expressed based on the type of survey and the question. But I'm not going to argue that my I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I believe Myron wasn't accurate in this statement in this report."
You would agree that he had data that he had reviewed at that time to reach that conclusion?,I would believe he would have data that he would have relied on to reach that conclusion.
Okay.,"But whether that the way the question was asked accurately reflects the truth of the marketplace, I don't know."
And it's the same as what you've said earlier,Yeah.
"that it's just different data sources reported differently, and it's a much more complicated question.","Yeah. 0 Q. Okay. Well, he also says that those are the years, the teenage years are the years in which initial brand selections are made. Is that true?"
"Are you testifying today on behalf of Philip 4 Morris that people in 1975 who are under the age of were unable to acquire cigarettes other than by taking them from their parents, stealing them from a store or bumming them off their friends?",
Okay. Because and I will ask for clarification because that's what it sounded like you 13 were saying. But certainly 15 to 17-year-olds in had many ways that they could acquire cigarettes by purchasing them.,Yes.
"And so that is also the period and lifestyle in which conformity to peer group norms is the greatest, 15 to 17-year-old. Do you agree with that 0 that age 15 to 17-year-old is when there's the strongest need to conform to what your peers are doing, your peer group?","It's a time in life when peer group influence is very very important. But whether it's stronger at 15 to 17 versus 10 to 14, I don't know."
Right.,The company wouldn't know. ji
Okay.,But I . . . yeah. |:
"Okay. You agree that a commitment, that age, 15 to 17 is the time when those peer group influences are very strong?",Yes. :
"And then later on here, you know, obviously Mr. Johnston goes through and he makes some correlations between Marlboro sales and 15 to 19-year-olds in various different analyses.",Yes. j
Do you see that? And showing correlation between Marlboro's performance and that changing segment of the population?,Yes. \
"If you look back at page five, you'll see ; let me just finish this document, if we can. So there's the changing brand preferences of ; young smokers?",Yeah.
And that was sort of reason number four that he identified for the decline in the rate of growth in Marlboro Red?,Yes.
"He says, ""A much more serious factor is the apparent decline in Marlboro's popularity among the young, as reported in the college student smoker survey."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"Okay. It says, ""Since this survey did not also sample the 70 percent of 18 to 22-year-olds who are not enrolled in college, we don't know if the results of the survey are projectable to the total population aged 18 to 22.""",Yes.
Do you see that?,"Yes. 0 Q. So here's he's looking at 18 to 22-year-olds, right?"
"If you look down at the bottom that last 4 paragraph of that section starting with, 5 ""Nonetheless...""",Yes.
"""Nonetheless, there is cause for concern partly because college students do not "" ""...do..."" excuse me ""...constitute a significant share of the Marlboro market and partly because college students' behavioral and attitudinal patterns tend to carry over to noncollege youth with a one to three-year lag as noted in various Yankelovich studies."" Did I pronounce that right?",Yep.
"""Thus, the decline in the popularity of Marlboro Red among younger smokers will probably continue and thus further reduce its rate of growth."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"So some of what Myron Johnston is recognizing there is that the behavioral and attitudinal patterns of these college students, it affects the next segment down the chain, if you will, 0 the younger students?","I I don't think that's what he's saying. I think what he's saying is that the college students who are 18 to 22, what they do influences the kids, the young adults that age who are not college students."
"You interpret that Since do not projec Because he's talking about the 70 percent. ji the survey did not also sample the 70 percent of ji 22-year-olds who are not enrolled in college, we ji know if the results of the survey are ji table to the total population age 18 to 24. ji Right. So I think what he's saying is I'm missing ji percent of the 18 to 24-year-olds in youth. And but ji I have information about the 3 0 percent that are the ji college students, and I think what they do influences i the other 70 percent. ji there, aren't So when he refers to noncollege youth down you're connecting that to the 18 to 22 that in college? In this couple paragraphs I am. ji In this section. Yes. j: Okay. Okay. I appreciate the clarification.",
"Okay. Miss Bonhomme, back on the record. Let me hand your counsel what is marked It doesn't appear to be marked, but it's PT5495. I don't know why that one didn't get marked. I'll mark that PT5495 on there. All right. So this is PT5495. It *s a June 5th, 1980 letter on Philip Morris inter-office correspondence from Myron Johnston, again, to a Mr. Jon Zoler. You see that?",Yes. I
The subject of this letter is teenage 0 smoking patterns and average daily cigarette consumption. Do you see that? 22 A. Yes.,
"Okay. And the only thing I really want to 4 call your attention to in this letter, which sort of for me contextual is that second paragraph where it starts with, ""Your request...""",All right. I'm with you.
"It says, ""Your request..."" which is presumably Mr. Zoler's request, correct?",Yes.
"""Your request plus the recent arrival of some information on teenage and college smoking incidence has prompted me to set to work on something I have wanted to do for sometime; study the demographic and socioeconomic variables related to teenage smoking and how those variables can be expected to influence the future incidence of smoking among teenagers and college age youth."" Do you see that?",Yes.
"Okay. And CC'd on this letter if you just turn to the second page there's a couple other individuals. So you have Dr. Seligman, who we mentioned before, and that that other letter from, I 0 think, '75 was written to?",Yes.
He's the director of research and development. And then you have Mr. Richard Thompson. 4 Do you know who that is?,"No. know who And then you have Mr. Harry Daniel. Do you Mr. Daniel was? Yes. |; Who is Mr. Daniel? I don't know all the positions he's had over ji his career, but he I'm familiar with Harry having ; been involved in the product testing area of product developme the more Q- Dr. Levy, mt in Richmond, Virginia. Okay. And do you know do you know what senior level positions that he held were. At the director level is the only thing. \ Director level? That's all I recall. j Okay. Then Dr. Carolyn Levy. You recognize I'm sure. Yes. She was your predecessor in the Youth Smoking Prevention Program? position Yes. She was she was she was my boss. Okay. And she was I never took over her i in youth smoking prevention. I reported to I her for many years in different assignments."
"All right. And I apologize. I must have been confused. I thought that when she that position that you were her successor, but I must have it backwards.","No, Howard I"
You worked underneath her?,Howard Willard was her successor. I j; reported to her ;
Okay,In that position. ji
"so that was June 5th, 1980 Mr. Johnston talking about his, you know, project that he's wanted to work on for sometime involving teenage smoking like ; we referred to earlier, right?",Yes. j (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT3405 for i.d.) \
"And so let me hand you PT 3405, which is a big document, big in pages, page length I should say. I'm sure you were stunned to see this one here today, right?",No. ;
"All right. So 52-page document that I just handed you, you can look at the last pages.",Okay. j
"This is a document dated March 13th, 1981. Right?",Yes. \
"So that document we looked at from Myron Johnston just a moment ago was June 5th, 1980. This is about nine months or so afterwards.","Yes, about that. ;i"
About nine or ten months?,"Yeah, about that. j"
"Nine or ten months later. And the title of this document is Well, let me back up a step. So we have this Philip Morris USA Research Center is at the top of the document on the first page?",Yes. j
"And I'm sorry. I'm looking at the page even before that. I apologize. Yeah, that page.","This page? \ Q A Q Yep. Start with that. Okay. 1: So that says Philip Morris USA Research Center. It's under type of report it's got special, little x-in the special box? A Q 1981. Yes. j And then it has the date there, March 31st, The report title is Young Smokers - Prevalence, Trends, Implications and Related Demographic Trends? A Q A Q A Q A Q Carol} A Q above A Q Yes. Written by Myron E. Johnston? That' s correct. j; And signed by Mr. Johnston above his name? Yes. j Approved by a Harry G. Daniel? That's correct. Signed by Mr. Daniel above his name and fn J. Levy. Yes. Miss Levy or, excuse me. Dr. Levy signed : her name as well? Yes. \ And then for distribution there's a number of individuals that are identified down there: Mr. Thompson again, Daniel, Levy, Meyer, Zoler and Goodale. You see that?"
"And if you go to the next page, second page, this is this report being transmitted to Dr. Seligman, Dr. Robert B. Seligman?",Yes. j
Director of research and development?,Yes. :
"For Philip Morris, I should say?",That's correct.
"Same date, March 31st, 1981, a letter on Philip Morris USA inter-office correspondence, do you see that?","Yes, Richmond, Virginia."
"Right. Richmond, Virginia, exactly. Same subject, Young Smokers - Prevalence, Trends, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends.",Yes. \
"Reading from the top there, ""For over years..."" so that would take us back to 1966 or earlier basically, right?","The date of the report, yeah. i"
Yeah. I'm just going from the 15 years to the other,"No, yeah, it does I don't know what the \ data goes look. Okc up to, if it's up to '81 or we'd have to i ay. \ Right, right, right. And I guess that's a fair point. It may be 15 years from the data if the data only would be, Q- somewhere goes to 80 or '79 or something like that. Right. Or if the data goes all the way to '81, it you know,'66. Yes. Somewhere in the '60s? Yes. I Is that fair? Yep. I Okay. So ""For over 15 years..."" back to in the 1960s ""...certain demographic and social trends have been moving in directions favorable to industry growth."" demograph. 1985, all Correct? Yes. ""Now one by one these powerful, social and Lc factors are turning against us. And by will be operating against us."" Did I read that correctly? Yes, you did. ; ""The trends are: Number one, after increasing for over a decade, the prevalence of teenage smoking is now declining sharply. ""Number two, After increasing for over a decade, the average daily consumption of teenage smokers is declining. ""Number three, After increasing 18 percent from 1967 to 1976, the absolute number of 15 to 19-year-olds will decline 19 percent during the 1980s with the period of sharpest decline beginning in 1981."" Did I read that correctly?"
"And then he also goes and talks about the absolute number of 20 to 24-year-olds, daily cigarette consumption has declined nationally, and in 1985, the number of people who are in the age group most disposed to quit smoking, ages 45 to 54, will begin to increase dramatically. Do you see that?",Yes.
"Sorry. Next page, ""It is inevitable, 0 therefore..."" Excuse me. Let me rephrase that. ""It is inevitable, therefore, that industry sales will begin to decline within the next few years. Do you see that?",Yes.
"And then looking down at the next paragraph, this report deals with only one of these trends, teenage smoking and attitudes towards smoking together with related demographics."" Do you see that?",Yes. j
"So, you know, he identifies, what was it, five six sort of different factors there. The first three sort of relate to teenage smoking. And he essentially says that this report isn't going to really i address four, five and six; is that fair?",That's fair. \
"Subsequent reports, though, will cover those other factors, if you will. And then after",
"All right, Miss Bonhomme. Back on the record. So we were looking at this document from j Myron Johnston.",Yes. I
"And I think we were on page, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner, look at page five, which is sort of the beginning of the document itself. We looked at the",Okay. I
"We looked at the letter to Dr. Seligman and sort of transmitting some summary information. Now we're in the actual document itself, the report, if you will.",Yes. |
"So if you look at page five there, it has a summary? 15 A. Yes.",
"All right. Let's read that summary together, ""It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and 0 the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. In addition, the ten years following the teenage years is the period during which average daily consumption per smoker increases to 4 the average adult level. The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. Of the 11 packings of which the median age of smokers is under age 30, seven are Philip Morris packings, and the share index is highest in the youngest age group for all Marlboro and Virginia Slims packings and for B&H, Benson & Hedges, Lights and Menthol."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes. \
"Furthermore, it is during the teenage years that the initial brand choice is made. At least a part of the success of Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck with it as they grew older, this combined with the rapid growth and the absolute number of teenagers."" Did I read that correctly?","Yes, you did."
"Based on this document and these conclusions, isn't it clear that teenage smokers are very important to Philip Morris?",
"Well, I mean, teenage smokers become adult smokers, right?","Yes. And when they are adults, they if they're smokers, they are important to Philip Morris. The company certainly recognizes that people age, and as people age, once they become an adult if they smoke, Philip Morris wants them to smoke one of the brand we make."
"Okay. But it's your testimony today that smokers, teenage smokers who are 18 or under are unimportant to Philip Morris?",
"Yeah, I said teenage smokers who are 18 and under are unimportant to Philip Morris.","And I'm restating it as an 18-year-old is of legal age to smoke. So teenagers who would be 18 and 19 and adults who are 20 and older are all important to Philip Morris if they're smokers. Individuals under 18, the company does not want individuals under 18 to smoke. When they become adults, if they choose to smoke, certainly the company wants them to purchase one of the brand we make."
"Okay. And obviously Myron Johnston wasn't talking about people who were 18 and older when he was talking about teenagers here, was he?","No, he was not."
"If you look down on the next paragraph there he says, ""Average daily consumption of these young smokers also increased, so that between 1968 and 1974, the number of 12 to 18-year-olds who smoked ten or more cigarettes per day more than doubled."" You see that?",Yes. 0 Q. So this group that he is identifying as being important to Philip Morris in this document is looking at 12 to 18-year-olds. Is that fair?
"Look at the next page, if you will. 3 A. Okay.",
"Source, paragraph where it starts with, ""The decline...""",Yes. |
"""The decline in the prevalence of teenage smoking has been sharper among boys than among girls. And now more girls than boys smoke cigarettes. The decline in teenage smoking has been particularly pronounced among blacks which may account for the decline in Kool's market share. The northeast has the highest prevalence of teenage smoking and the west has the lowest. Between 1975 and 1979 the proportion of teenagers who say they definitely will not be smoking five years hence has increased dramatically. ""The major reasons for the decline are the perceived health hazards of smoking and peer pressure not to smoke."" 0 Do you see that?","I do. I 2 Q. So one of the one of the major reasons identified for the decline in the number of teenage 4 smokers is peer pressure not to smoke, sort of a shift 5 in that, it was cool to smoke and now it's not cool to | smoke, right?"
The other reason is because of perceptions or beliefs about whether smoking is a health hazard?,Yes. j
"So the more people became aware, the more people knew, believed that smoking was a health hazard, that also depressed the incident of teenage smoking?",
"Well, let me",If you can just rephrase.
Sure. Let me rephrase it. The a major reason for the decline in teenage smoking between '75 and '79 was the teenager's perceptions regarding the health hazards of smoking?,Yes. ;
"So as they more teenagers became aware or perceived smoking to be a health hazard, they were less likely to smoke; is that another way to say that?",Yes. !:
So the concern he's expressing here isn't about forecasting. The concern he's expressing here is about the fact that this ever-increasing pool of teenage smokers that had been there in the past won't be there in the future as smokers either quit or die?,
"That's the conclusion he's drawing, right?",Repeat what you state the conclusion is.
"The conclusion that he's drawing is that unlike in the past where the industry could rely on an ever-increasing pool of teenage smokers, new smokers to i; begin smoking to replace those individuals who would either die or quit as adult smokers, that trend is ending. They can't rely on that anymore because of the decline in the percent of teenagers who smoke, the decreased levels of consumption amongst those teenagers and the decline in the absolute numbers of teenagers?",
"Did you see that conclusion is drawn? let Again, I'm not following the question, so j; Well, you said earlier that this was just maybe forecasting. He's trying to look at these people will become adults at some point, so that's why the teenagers document. yes . that. He teenagers are important, right? Do you recall that? Yes. That's my understanding of this jj Well, what he says I'm sorry. That's my understanding of this document, What he says here is a little different than says that the decline in the percent of who smoke, okay, so the declining percentage of teenagers who are smokers, right?",Yes.
"And the decline in the absolute numbers, mean, you know, as part of the population, there are just fewer teenagers around, right?",Yes.
"Well, that means that the industry can no longer rely on an ever-increasing pool of teenage smokers to replace adult smokers lost through natural attrition. Do you see that?",Yes.
"So what he's saying is is that as these trends have changed now, we can no longer rely upon an ever-increasing pool of teenagers who will become new smokers to replace the adult smokers who either quit or died? That's the conclusion he draws.","Well, my interpretation of the conclusion he's drawing is saying in the future we can no longer rely on the demographics and the incidence of smoking to when you look at the future marketplace. I mean, throughout this document I'm now left with the impression that he's talking about today and today's marketplace. He's talking about today and what's going on in the population because of what it means for the future. So as people die, as people leave the market is like a future forward statement, right? So I don't think he's saying today. He's not saying this is the situation today and I'm explaining today's market. I think he's saying I'm looking at the population of the United States, demographics of teenagers, smoking rates, and I'm using that to think about the future and what it means for the company. That's my interpretation of this document."
"Well, as we looked at before, he's looking at the past for over 15 years and explaining how those trends were unfavorable to the industry, right?",Yes.
Favorable to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies?,Yes.
"And he's saying that those trends are now changing, and it's going to be different in the future, right?",That's right. That's what he's saying.
"But the difference that he's noting is and maybe let me back up a step because obviously Mr. Johnston as identified in his other documents, he's 4 under the he has the belief that most people who become regular smokers are ready regular smokers by the time they're 18, right?","He's of that opinion in this document, yes."
And he's of that opinion in other documents. That's been his conclusion in the work that he's done 5 for Philip Morris that people are regular smokers by by and large?,"I've seen that stated in other documents. But I don't I don't have a review of all of Myron's work, so..."
"I understand. Just in the ones we looked at you and I together today we've seen that, right?",Yes.
"And so if that's the case, if most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18, that's consistent with what he's noting here as far as the concern that we can no longer rely upon this ever-increasing pool of teenagers to replace the adult smokers that we've lost through natural attrition as he calls it?","I think that's what he's saying. He's saying because of changes in the population, changes in smoking rates, changes in consumption among individuals in their teenage years, the marketplace going forward is going to be very different for the company. I think that's what he's saying. I think that's his -- that's his point of view."
"Right. And the basis for that is that it's the teenage smoking that's changing. Under the age of 18, that's what he's talking about?","That is what he's talking about. He also talks about over 18, but he is talking about under 18."
"But that's the basis for his sounding the alarm as he sees it, if you will, in this document?",I think that's the basis for his analysis yes .
"All right. One of the other things that's mentioned in here is that, you know, the natural attrition here for a student, you know, adult, that these teenage smokers were necessary to replace adult smokers lost through natural attrition. Do you see that, on that same page?",I remember reading it.
"Yes, it's on that same page right there, same sentence.","Yes, I see it. 0 Q. And earlier we, I think we looked at the fact that, you know, he mentions in here if you want to go back to the summary, you can, on page five, but he mentions that, you know, the prime quitting age, 2 4 that age where that natural attrition occurs is ages to 54. Do you see that?"
She was 52. So she would have been in that prime quitting age?,
"Just based on her age in this document, right?","In this document, yes. !;"
"All right, Miss Bonhomme. Thank you for your patience today. I just have one additional document that I want to go over with you that relates to the same subject we've been talking about already. And this is PT6030 for the record, January 19, Philip Morris inter-office correspondence, Myron Johnston again to Mr. Jon Zoler. Do you see that?",Yes. !:
The subject is the ages at which people start smoking.,Yes. j
"Okay. So first line there says, ""Conventional wisdom has long held that anyone who has not started smoking by age 18 is unlikely ever to become a smoker."" Do you see that?",Yes. \
And what Mr. Johnston is referring to there is the conventional wisdom held by the individuals within Philip Morris?,
"Right. I mean, the people who work for Philip Morris are also a part of society, aren't they?","Yes, they are. i"
"Yes. So, I mean, if it's society, it's six and one-half dozen of the other. But he's saying that people have understood, people who work for Philip Morris presumably because that's who he's writing to is his colleague, John Zoler, people have long conventional wisdom has long held that anyone who has not started smoking by age 18 is unlikely ever to become a smoker, right?","That's what he wrote, yes. |"
"All right. And he goes on in this document and actually says that it's a little bit off, that a better way to say it is that anyone who has not become a smoker by age 25 isn't likely to become a smoker. He kind of extends it out a little bit, right?",Quite a bit. I
"Yeah, right. And we look back at the next page. We can see some of the data on this. So the table that he's got there is white males and white females, right? 0 A. Yes, yes. |",
"If you just look at the line in the middle there, that percent of smokers who started before age 4 A. Yes. f",
"And the same is true for both the white males and the white females, that's kind of how it's broken down?","Yes, and I was confused by that information because I it things don't add up on this chart, so I thought that might be a typo, and it's supposed to be percent of smokers who started before age 21, but I I'm not a hundred percent sure. But if you look at the data above it, 9 started before 18, started 18 to"
Right.,"and then percent of smokers who started before age 18, the numbers don't really line up."
The math doesn't?,"Yeah, no, it doesn't, so I was left with the impression that that should be -- should be percent of smokers who started before age 21."
Um-hum. Well,"But I don't have the original data to, you know, go back and 0 Q. Yeah. Let's look at the line above it, 21 then, just so it's clear. So for the started before with the white males there you have 61.5, of those who graduate maybe that's what it is it's because it's 4 high school grad, not high school grad, some college, college graduate. No, the math still doesn't make sense, A Q A does it? No, it doesn't. ij No. All right. And I spent time with this trying to explain ji this data to myself, and I wasn't able to be clear. ji Q A Okay. Well So as an attorney, if you can explain it to ji someone who's worked in market research, that would be ji app] don got reciated. ji Q 't Sure. You know, rather than do that, why I just not use this document. Sometimes you just to pack your lunch and go home."
"Good afternoon, Miss Bonhomme.",Good afternoon.
"You know my name is Bill Geraghty, and I represent Philip Morris USA?",Yes.
"I'm going to ask you some questions in follow-up to the questions that Mr. Bigger asked you about. And at some point I'm going to ask you to explain to the jury your background and your credentials and your work history and in particular with Philip Morris. But before I do that, I want to ask you a couple of questions. And what I'd like you 0 to do is could you take a look at the very last document that Mr. Bigger talked to you about? It's a 2 January 13th, 1983 memo from a Mr. Myron Johnston to a Mr. Jon Zoler, right? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And you and Mr. Bigger had he asked you a number of questions at various points during the deposition about the percentage of people who begin smoking under the age of 18. Right?","Yes, he did. j:"
"You and Philip Morris acknowledge that some people do begin smoking under the age of 18, right?",That's right.
"If I understood what you were saying to Mr. Bigger correctly, what is more complicated and more difficult to identify precisely is the exact percentage ; of people who may begin smoking before the age of 18; is that fair?",That's fair. j
"During the course of the afternoon in particular, Mr. Bigger showed you a number of documents written by this individual who was a former employee of Philip Morris, Mr. Johnston, correct?",Correct. i
"And he was employed by Philip Morris, right?","Yes, he was. \"
His position was a demographer?,Yes. j
And what is a demographer just briefly?,It's a position where an individual studies I the demographics of the population and various : demographic statistics of the population to understand facts about American society.
And that was his role at Philip Morris?,"Yes, it was."
"Okay. He was not in the Marketing Department or the Market Research Department, was he?","No, he wasn't. He worked in Richmond, Virginia. The Marketing and Marketing Research Departments were in New York City."
"Now did Well, let me back up. Mr. Bigger showed you a number of statements written by Mr. Johnston in 1975, in the late '70s and right up to 1980 and '81 where Mr. Johnston expressed his view that the majority or the overwhelming majority of people begin smoking before the age of 18, correct?",Correct.
"The document that Mr. Bigger just handed you at the end of his examination is from several years later in 1983, right?",Yes.
"In that document, does Mr. Johnston acknowledge in 1983 that many of the statements he had made earlier on that subject were, in fact, incorrect?",
"Right. He actually in the very second sentence of that document said, ""I had also pretty much accepted that as an article of faith,"" correct?",Yes.
"But if we go deeper into the document in the second paragraph, he acknowledges that the data he's now looking at indicates that the percentage of people who begin smoking before their 18th birthday is in the range of about 35 percent. Correct?",Yes. Correct.
"And so if we drop down to the first sentence in the fourth paragraph, and this was a statement that Mr. Bigger had referenced to you, Mr. Johnston says, clearly, ""Conventional wisdom has to be rephrased to 0 read 'anyone who has not become a smoker by age 25 is unlikely to become a smoker, '"" right?",Right.
Okay. So that's his rephrasing of what he 4 thinks the conventional wisdom is as of 1983 given the data he's looking at at that point in time?,Yes.
Now let's shift gears for a second. And I want to talk to you about Barbara Lourie. You understand that Barbara Lourie is the cigarette smoker and that her husband is the plaintiff who has filed this lawsuit?,"That's my understanding, yes."
In the course of preparing to testify today were you provided with some information about Barbara Lourie's smoking history?,"Yes, I was."
Now based on the information you provided from the deposition testimony of her husband did Barbara Lourie smoke any Philip Morris brand of cigarettes before she turned the age of 18?,
"Okay. And based on the information you were 2 provided from the deposition testimony of her husband, when did Barbara Lourie first start smoking a Philip 4 Morris brand of cigarettes on any regular basis?","It was in the 1970s. And she would have been about 30ish, maybe a little younger, maybe a little older."
So I think Mr. Bigger and you agreed that Barbara Lourie was born in 1945; is that correct?,That's correct.
"So if Barbara Lourie started smoking, and the brand that she started smoking in the mid 1970s was Marlboro Red?",Marlboro Red.
"Okay. So if he she started smoking Marlboro Red in the mid 1970s, and let's say for purposes of this question around 1975, how old would she have been?",She would have been 30.
"An adult cigarette smoker, right?","Yes, an adult cigarette smoker."
And smoking for a number of years before she started smoking Marlboro Red on a regular basis?,Yes.
"There was some testimony about Marlboro 0 Green which is Marlboro Menthol, right?",That is correct.
Have you been provided with any information to indicate that Barbara Lourie ever smoked Marlboro 4 Green?,No.
"If Barbara Lourie had started smoking Marlboro Red in the mid 1970s, according to her husband, would every pack of cigarettes, every pack of \ Marlboro cigarettes she bought, would that have had a Surgeon General's warning on the pack?",Yes. j
"Now having had the opportunity to review with Mr. Bigger the series of documents he showed you from the 1940s through the early 1980s, do you see any \ connection between the documents that were showed to you by Mr. Bigger and Barbara Lourie starting to smoke ; Marlboro Red cigarettes in the mid 1970s?",
Now there's been a couple of references to Philip Morris's Youth Smoking Prevention Program. And !; you were involved in that program?,"Yes, I was."
What was your position with the program?,I worked as the director of the research i function of youth smoking prevention. i
And for how many years were you involved with or part of Philip Morris's Youth Smoking Prevention Program?,About four years.
"All right. Now as director of research of the Youth Smoking Prevention Program, did you read scientific studies done by government agencies, the public health community, and other experts that talked about the reasons why people under the age of 18 begin smoking cigarettes?","Yes, I did. It was an important part of the job."
"And you actually referred to some of this research, did you not, during the course of Mr. Bigger's questions?","Yes, I did."
"Okay. And as a matter of fact, I think he showed you a document well, let me ask it this way. Were you shown a document where a Philip Morris employee had sort of basically quoted significantly from a lot of the research that had been done on that particular subject? 0 A. Yes.",
"All right. And you've become familiar with 2 those studies and that research as part of your work with the Youth Smoking Prevention Program, correct?","Studies of that type, yes."
"You alluded to some of this with Mr. Bigger, but, again, for the benefit of the jury give us the top three or four reasons cited by the experts regarding why someone under the age of 18 might start smoking cigarettes.","Well, there are many reasons, but at the top of the list is peer pressure. Kids are very much influenced by what their friends do. Parental smoking is also a risk factor for a young person smoking. And then access to being able to get cigarettes. You know, if a kid can't get cigarettes even if they try one or two cigarettes from a friend, if they can't buy them and don't have a steady supply, they don't go on to become a smoker. So I say those are the ones that really are at the top of the list. And then there would be protective factors, things that would discourage kids from smoking that, you know, would be important also."
"So let me just I'm going to package what you said and kind of rephrase it. So among at least, 0 among the top reasons would be peer pressure, whether their parents smoke cigarettes and whether they, in fact, have access to cigarettes?",Yes. 4 Q. Would you include within the broad umbrellas of peer pressure and parental smoking also whether they have older siblings or friends who smoke cigarettes?
Okay.,Because that's an important access point for young people.
Okay. Let's go back to Barbara Lourie for just a moment. Have you seen information that shows how Barbara Lourie first started to smoke cigarettes in the 1950s?,"I heard information, yes."
And what did you hear?,That she took cigarettes from her parents.
"Okay. I mean, is that method by which or that happenstance by which some people under the age of 18 get access to cigarettes and start smoking consistent or typical with the research that you've read over the years?",Yes.
"Have you seen any connection between 0 well, let me strike that question. Let's talk about your background a little bit. And before I get into your education, are you married, Miss Bonhomme?","Yes, I am."
And do you h a v e c h i l d r e n ?,I have two. I have a boy and a girl. s
And are they adults now?,Yes. |;
"Okay. If you could, and just briefly, tell us about your educational background beginning with where you went to college.","I went to college at Rider College in New j: Jersey, and I have an undergraduate degree in marketing :| and enough credits to have a major in accounting as \ well. And then I have a grad graduate degree in tax : accounting which is an MBA, and I obtained the graduate I degree by going to school in the evening while working in the field of marketing research."
"Okay. So your graduate degree, if I understand correctly, is in tax accounting?",Yes.
All right.,It's in but it's an MBA. j
It's an MBA. All right. And that was at what university?,Fairleigh Dickinson University. j:
"And then upon graduating with the MBA in tax accounting, walk us through, if you could, your initial employment after graduating from school.","Well, I initially, my initial part-time : employment was after my undergraduate degree because I got the graduate degree In the evening while going to school for many years at night while working. So my first position out of college in with my degree in marketing was I worked as a forecaster for Burlington Industries, and I had responsibility for forecasting the production of fabric in their manufacturing centers, which were mostly in the southern part of the United States."
"Okay. And let me ask you to pause, and I want to you explain that because I want you to explain to the jury what a forecaster is, and I want you to do that because you had talked about some of the documents that Mr. Johnston had written as being forecasting documents. So first what is a forecaster?","A forecaster is someone who uses information, and they do an analysis to try to predict what either a company should make or what a company should buy or what the market share is going to be for a brand. So the forecasting job that I had was I had to look at marketplace information and then use that to build a forecast so that the company that I worked for would make the right amount of material in their manufacturing centers . So"
"Is part of forecasting, at least, trying to determine the demand for a product within the market?","That's a piece of it, yes."
Okay. So you did that as one of your first jobs right out of college?,Right out of college.
"Okay. If you continue, then, with the work you did from that point forward, please...","Then the next position I moved I wanted to work in more in survey marketing research, so I went to work at a, what's called a marketing research supplier."
"Let me ask you to stop here for a second. You've used the term ""marketing research."" What is marketing research?","Marketing research is studying the marketplace on behalf of a company so that the company can be informed about either its consumers or what's going on in the marketplace, like what brands are popular, what brands are not popular so that they can help the company make better decisions. Marketing researchers also study the consumer by showing that consumer some of the ideas that companies are thinking about putting into the marketplace to get reactions."
Okay. And so you said you started you were interested in jobs in marketing research.,Yes.
"And I sort of cut you off to ask you to explain that before you told us about the jobs you actually obtained, so",Yes.
"continue, please.","So my next position I joined a company called Marketing Information Systems. And they had a number of large corporations as clients. And I had responsibility for writing questionnaires and overseeing the collection of feedback from consumers and then writing, charting up the data and writing reports for these clients to give them feedback on what they were thinking about putting in the market or what was going on in the marketplace."
"So if I understand what you're telling me correctly, a lot of what's involved in marketing research is actually speaking directly with consumers 0 to try to understand what they might want, what they need and what they like?","It's either done through interviews, it could be through surveys, questionnaires or it could be through like maybe a focus group process. But, yes, a big piece of consumer research is getting feedback from consumers on the ideas that a company is thinking of putting into the marketplace and then along the way assessing their preferences in the marketplace."
So do most consumer product companies have a market research or a Marketing Research Department or arm?,"Yes, they do."
Give us a flavor for some of the types of products for which you did marketing research or worked on before this is all before we get to Philip Morris.,"Sure. The high prime responsibility when I became more senior in the company for work on the Seagram's business, Seagram's made spirits, they were in the alcohol business. And then I had prime responsibility for one of the divisions of Johnson & Johnsons. So those were the two largest clients in terms of my workload. But in addition to that, over the course of the years that I worked there I worked on Kenner Toys, Block Drug, American Cyanamid, so many companies. Bristol-Myers, Clairol. I mean, I had a broad they had quite a few clients in at this company. And in my more junior years there I would handle projects on various clients at various points in time."
Now tell us how it is that you came to work for Philip Morris.,"I was recruited by a headhunter. They reached out to me about a position at Philip Morris and another company, and I came on the interview and was interviewed a number of times, and I was offered a job."
And what year was this that you started working for Philip Morris?,In 1979.
All right. And what was your first position with Philip Morris?,I was an analyst in the Marketing Research Department.
And briefly what does an analyst in the Marketing Research Department do?,"Pretty much the same type of work I was doing when he worked at the marketing research company. I was, you know, writing surveys, analyzing data, overseeing the collection of data and overseeing the kinds of companies similar to the company I had worked for. And in that process then I would support the brand organization. So I would work based on what the marketing organization wanted to know about some of the things they were putting in the market. I would be the person who would collect that information and analyze it and come back to them with knowledge."
"Okay. You've used the term ""brand organization.""",(Nodding head).
"What do you mean when you say ""brand organization? ""","I mean, the marketing organization. The way the company is structured there's a department that has responsibility for each of the brands. So like Marlboro has, in the brand organization Marlboro has people who are dedicated to working on Marlboro. And they are the group that coordinate the efforts of the company for Marlboro. And they oversee what goes into the marketplace on behalf of Marlboro. So the Marketing Research Department helps support the brand group so that when they put something in the market we've already gotten feedback from consumers. So what goes into the market is something that, you know, we think consumers are going to like. 0 Q. So when you refer to brand, you mean Marlboro was a brand?"
Benson & Hedges is a brand?,Yes.
"Of b o t h b r a n d s o f c i g a r e t t e s made by P h i l i p n a t u r e ? Philip Morris. Coca Cola would be a brand? That's correct. Pepsi would be a brand? That's correct. Tide is a brand. Kleenex would be a brand, things of that Yes, yes. And when I say consumers at Philip Morris, it's different from the consumers when I worked at the marketing research company, consumers would be adult smokers.",
"Okay. Now you've mentioned market research, and you explained what that is, and you mentioned marketing. Were there was there both a market research and a Marketing Department at Philip Morris?",Yes.
"Can you explain difference, please?","Yes. The Marketing Research Department studies either what's going on in the marketplace or they study the consumer. And when they study the consumer, they study the consumer by getting feedback on some of the programs that maybe the Marketing Department wants to put in the market. So let's say the Marketing Department wants to change the pack design of one of the brands. They would coordinate with the Marketing Research Department. The Marketing Research Department would write a questionnaire, design a methodology and interview people and maybe show these adult smokers the packs that were under consideration, get that information back and then report back to the Marketing Department. The Marketing Department would be the group that ultimately made the decision on what was going to go in the marketplace and oversaw the programs in the marketplace."
"So they're separate departments, but they work together?","Yes, they do."
And the research developed by marketing research informs presumably the decisions that the Marketing Department ultimately makes?,"Yes, it does."
"If you could, walk us through the positions that you held while you were employed with Philip Morris USA.","Okay. Well, I started as an analyst in the Consumer Research Department. And I worked, then I was then I was promoted through that department until I basically became the director of the Consumer Research Department. For a portion of the time I worked three days a week. It was when my children were young, and I wanted to spend more time with them. So for about ten years during the time frame I was in the Consumer Research Department, I worked as a consultant pretty much functioning at the manager level."
So Okay. So you were working less than full time?,Yes.
But still performing the same duties as when you were a full-time employee?,Yes.
And that was something you wanted to do and Philip Morris was was happy to allow to do that?,"Yes, they accommodated what I requested."
Now you used the term Consumer Research Department. Is there a difference between that and marketing research or market research?,"Yes, the Consumer Research Department studies the consumer, and a portion of the Marketing Research Department is a there's the entire organization would be called market research, and there are two main components. One is consumer research where that group studies the consumer, and the other is a group of market researchers who study the marketplace. They would look at what brands are selling. They would look at forecasting for what brands they think will grow versus decline and study what's going on in the market. Not necessarily with people."
Okay. So you were telling us that at this point at least you had become the director of the Consumer Research Department?,Yes.
And did you hold other positions thereafter?,"I did. In 1998, so basically from 1979 to 1998 I was in a capacity in the Consumer Research Department with various positions and various types of work. And my span of control increased. And in 1998 I became the director of the Direct Marketing Department."
And what is the Direct Marketing Department?,"The Direct Marketing Department is one of the marketing departments, and it has responsibility for all of the direct mail that goes to smokers. You know all of the mail that goes out to adult smokers, they I had responsibility for those programs."
And you did that for several years?,For about two years.
And then you became the director of research or director of youth smoking prevention research?,Yes. 4 Q. And for how long were you in that role?
"And when you talk about litigation support to speak on behalf of the company, you're talking about being asked as you were in this particular instance to serve as a corporate representative speaking on behalf of the company?",Yes.
All right. And you're compensated for the time you spend doing that particular work?,Yes.
"All right. Now how many years total, then, have you worked in market research?","Well, I worked a little bit when I was in college in market research, but we could put that to the side because that was just part-time work. So, in essence, from when I graduated, which was in 1973, 19 early 1974 until 2008, I was I would say, you know, I think we can subtract the two years from the direct Marketing Department. So it's over 35. 4 Q. Okay. Roughly 35 years in market and consumer research?"
"And I think you actually already sort of referenced this. But in as a market researcher, have you ever spoken with adult cigarette smokers?",All the time.
"And over the course of the 30 plus years you were involved in market and consumer research for Philip Morris, approximately how many adult cigarette smokers have you spoken to?","Well, if you count the surveys in terms of questionnaires and questions, it's not like direct interviews. If you think of all the surveys and all the data, it would be hundreds of thousands of consumers of adult smokers."
And can you give us just a little bit of a flavor for the types of surveys or research where you have the occasion to speak with adult cigarette smokers?,"Well, the ones where you speak to people directly, those would be focus groups or one-on-one interviews. And then, in essence, those are projects where you invite adult smokers to come into a conference room or into a facility or you stop them in a shopping mall. And you screen for eligibility to 5 make sure they're over age and they smoke. And you would speak to them face to face and maybe show them some things that are under consideration. And in other cases where it wasn't an in-person interview, there would be surveys written, people, you know, questionnaires are written to get impressions from consumers about what they like, what they don't like, what they're interested in and to get an understanding of them to develop insights in order to be successful with the programs we put in the market."
"Okay. Let's switch gears here for a second. And what I'd like to do is talk to you briefly about why you are here testifying today. Is it your understanding that under under the Rules of Procedure that apply to this case that Mr. Lourie and his attorney, Mr. Bigger, have the right to ask Philip Morris USA to designate a representative to discuss specific issues regarding the company's advertising and marketing?",
And is it your understanding that you were 4 asked by Philip Morris USA to serve as its representative to testify on the topics that were designated by the plaintiff and Mr. Bigger?,"That's my understanding, yes."
And you understand those topics to include the issue of youth smoking and marketing to youth?,Yes.
"All right. The time frame of the subject matter that Mr. Bigger and the plaintiff have designated goes back to the 1940s, does it not?",Yes.
"Tell us just in your own words what experience do you have, hands-on experience to serve as the corporate representative on behalf of Philip Morris to address the topics that have been designated for today's deposition.","Well, all the years of work that I've had at the company give me a firsthand understanding of the company's practices and policies. And because I worked in the marketing organization or the marketing research organization for the bulk of my career, I had was familiar with what went in the market because oftentimes my group was providing feedback on those programs. And so that would be my firsthand experience."
Okay.,"And I knew management. I worked closely and reported in to senior management on marketing issues oftentimes. And then in addition to that, in preparation for today I reviewed the documents that I was asked to look at. But prior to that since I had been involved in speaking as the company requested me to in other cases, I've reviewed many many other documents."
"Let me let me ask you just a few things about what you've just said to sort of get some specific answers from you. So if I understand correctly, are you able based upon your work with the company to provide information based on your firsthand experience from the time you arrived in the company in 1979?","Yes, I am."
Okay. And now is anyone who worked in marketing for Philip Morris from the 1940s or '50s or '60s still around today? 2 A. No.,That's correct.
And have you reviewed many documents that describe those practices?,"Yes, I have. And I've reviewed many of the marketing and media plans, you know, over the years."
"Now for purposes of today's deposition, did 11 the plaintiff designate approximately 40 or documents that the plaintiff and his attorney wanted to discuss with you today?",Yes.
Okay. And you reviewed those documents?,I did.
"To the extent that you were able to locate them, did you review additional documents that relate to the 40 or 42 that the plaintiff designated in an 0 effort to try to put them in an appropriate context within the company and its history?","Yes, I did."
"Let me ask you another question, Miss Bonhomme. The handful of documents that you've discussed with Mr. Bigger, did you locate other documents that discuss whether many of the ideas expressed in those documents were ever actually endorsed or approved or followed up on by more senior people within the company?","Yes, I did."
And did you review those documents for purposes of being able to answer Mr. Bigger's questions or my questions today?,Yes.
"And whether I I don't want to limit it to the documents you reviewed for purposes of today. You have served as a corporate representative for Philip Morris on marketing and advertising issues in other cases, have you not?",Yes.
"And whether it was for today's deposition or those earlier depositions, have you read many many documents that refer to the activities of the Market 4 Research Department and the Marketing Department at Philip Morris?","Yes, I have. I've reviewed many many marketing documents."
"Okay. While we're talking about that particular subject, there was a well, let me back up here and withdraw that. Let's start over here. I want to switch gears with you, and I want to talk generally speaking about Philip Morris fs cigarette brand advertising and marketing. Okay?",Okay.
And then within that I'll probably ask you about some of the specific issues Mr. Bigger asked you about. Who is the target audience for Philip Morris USA cigarette brand advertising and marketing?,Adults who smoke.
Does Philip Morris USA market its cigarette brands to persons under the age of 18?,No.
"Just very generally speaking, what is the goal of Philip Morris USA cigarette brand advertising 0 and marketing?",To communicate to communicate a message about a brand so that adult smokers purchase it.
And does Philip Morris believe or strike 4 that. Does Philip Morris market its cigarette brands to try to influence the brand choices that adult cigarette smokers make?,"Yes, that's an important purpose."
And do you believe that cigarette brand advertising and marketing can influence those decisions that adult smokers make?,"Yes, I do. j"
"Now as you and Mr. Bigger discussed, teenagers under the age of 18 do smoke cigarettes, right?","Yes, some of them do. I"
Some of them do. And has that been going on for many years?,Yes. j
Is Philip Morris the only corporation or entity that had knowledge that some people start smoking under the age of 18?,No. It was not at all. ;
Okay. Was the government aware of that?,Yes. ;
The public health community?,Yes. j
And society in general?,
Now in your mind I just want to make sure this is clear. Is there a distinction in your mind between Philip Morris being aware that some people under the age of 18 start smoking cigarettes on the one hand and on the other whether Philip Morris had a specific intent to advertise and market its cigarette brands to people under the age of 18?,
"And what Can you explain that further for us, please?","Yes. Philip Morris creates marketing programs to bring to market products that would be appealing to adult smokers. So all the research that's done to develop those programs is done with adults. And that's the target audience for Philip Morris brands. So it's what Philip Morris puts into the marketplace that matters. I mean, having knowledge that young people smoke doesn't mean that Philip Morris is going to create programs or initiatives to encourage them to smoke. It's quite the contrary. What Philip Morris does is basically what goes into the marketplace. And if you look at the marketing plans, you can see what goes into the market place and what they sell and how they promote their brands."
Now in all of your experience with Philip Morris have you seen any indication that Philip Morris intended to advertise and market its cigarette brands to people under the age of 18?,"No, not in their marketing programs, no."
All right. Now I want to dive in a little bit more deeply about what you were telling us earlier about kind of the role or function of market research. So what was the function of the Market Research Department at Philip Morris?,"It was to provide information to management or the marketing organization so that they could make better decisions. 0 Q. Okay. Let me see. You earlier you referenced a couple of different sort of things that 2 market research might be focused on. And I just want to make sure I kind of have those down, and I may 4 I'm going to ask you about it. Is one, I think you 5 under you mentioned understanding the marketplace generally speaking?"
"Okay. Another function or, I guess, role, if you will, that you mentioned was and correct me if I'm wrong, but that market research would look into consumers' reactions to advertising campaigns, promotional materials, things that the company might want to introduce into the marketplace?","That would be more consumer research. So within the Marketing Research Department there's a function that's called consumer research, and that was a function I had responsibility for for many years. And that department does quite a diversity of work, but mostly you can bucket into work to help the marketing organization develop what's going into the market. So that, and then they also do some general consumer preference research."
Right. You you told us a moment ago that Philip Morris tests some of its advertising and marketing programs by showing them to consumers before they go into the market place.,"Oh, yeah, yes, uh-huh."
And you mentioned maybe a change to a cigarette pack. But could you give us a specific example of how you might test an advertising or marketing program with consumers before it goes into the marketplace?,"Sure. Sure. If the company was considering a new advertising campaign for one of its brands or bringing sometimes different executions of an existing campaign, we would convene, invite adult smokers to focus groups and show them some of the materials being considered. Sometimes there might be three or four ad campaigns that the company was considering for a particular brand, so we would show people the campaigns, and everyone we interviewed would be an adult smoker and get their reaction, and then that feedback would go back to the marketing organization. And then they might modify some of the advertising based on that feedback or they might eliminate a couple of the campaigns that were being considered. So it's pretty standard work. It's the same technique for considering the new continuity item or a new package design or a new name for a brand that's going to come into the marketplace."
Are you aware of any instance in which Philip Morris tested its advertising or marketing programs with anyone under the age of 18?,. I am n o t .
"Is I thought I heard you say this earlier. You mentioned, if I understood you correctly, that one part of market or consumer research might include understanding consumer preferences generally?",Yes.
From the time you joined the company what was the minimum age of the cigarette smokers who participated in that particular type of research?,Legal age and older.
Was that also true as a general rule before you joined the company?,"Yes, as a general rule, it was. 0 Q. Okay. Now I think Mr. Bigger may have showed you I don't want to I'm not I don't want to misstate the number but a couple of documents from before the time you joined the company showing 4 that Philip Morris on occasion looked into the consumer preferences of people under the age of 18; is that correct?"
"In your experience, in your experience with Philip Morris, was this typical of the company's practices?",It was not. It was rare. ;
Was it consistent with the company's practices from your perspective?,
"The one, there was one in particular that just comes to mind. It was a document, the title of which was The New Competition For Marlboro's Franchise. Do you recall that one?","I remember -- I remember that document, yes. ji"
"From 1974. Do you agree that that's something, that particular research as reflected in that document was something the company shouldn't have done?",They should have not done it. i
And are you here personally to try to defend that particular document?,
"Okay. Now I want to ask you, though, about two things. First, during the same period of time, did you see instances in which Philip Morris rejected suggestions by outside companies to do research with people who were under the age of 18?",Yes.
"Okay. And as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of the Opinion Research Corporation. Mr. Bigger showed you some documents from the Opinion Research Corporation, right?","Yes, he did."
"And the particular study, the teenage study that was referenced in the document from the individual at the opinion research study (sic), did Philip Morris reject the request or the suggestion that they participate in that study?","Yes, they did. 0 Q. Now I also want to ask you focusing, again, on this document, The New Competition For Marlboro's Franchise, that document was forwarded to some folks within the company by Mr. Al Udow on July 25th, 1974. 4 Does that sound about right?"
I could show you the particular document.,I recall it . ji
"But there's also another document dated the very same day, July the 25th of 1974 where that Al Udow wrote to Mr. James Morgan.",I remember that document. ;
"And if I recall correctly, Mr. James Morgan was in charge of the Marlboro brand at that point in time?","Yes, he was."
"That particular document Al Udow talked about well, let me back up. Mr. Bigger talked about a problem that was identified in the, I guess, the slowing of the growth of Marlboro as a brand in about 1974.",Yes.
"And in the memo that Mr. Udow wrote to James Morgan, he made recommendations for things he thought the company, quote, might do to address that problem, right?","Yes, he had some suggestions."
"And you've read that memo carefully, have you not?",I have.
And have you looked into whether or not any of the recommendations that Mr. Udow made in that document were accepted by Mr. Morgan and then incorporated into Philip Morris's advertising and marketing of Marlboro?,
So this is another example of someone making ; a suggestion that was ultimately not followed up or adopted by the company itself?,
"And that's what I wanted to ask you about. Just if we were to pick 1979 or 1980, about how many people worked for Philip Morris generally?","Oh, thousands. I mean, I don't know how i many exactly, but..."
And how many employees would have been in marketing and market research?,Over a hundred.
Okay. And do many Individuals in your experience I'm asking about your experience with other companies and particularly with Philip Morris. In your experience do individual employees make suggestions and come up with ideas about how the company's products ought to be sold or marketed or advertised?,Sure. That's what the company wants. They appreciate suggestions.
"And is every single suggestion that an individual employee makes with respect to how the company's product ought to be advertised, marketed or sold adopted by the company?",Of course not.
"Frankly, in the scheme of things with respect to most of the ideas and suggestions employees 0 come up with, what happens to most of the ideas?",
"Okay. And that last answer, is that based on your personal firsthand experience working at Philip Morris for 30 some odd years?","Yes, it is."
Okay. Mr. Bigger also showed you a number of documents written by Mr. Myron Johnston that discussed smoking rates of people under 18. You recall that?,Yes.
Okay. Did you know Myron Johnston personally when you were employed at Philip Morris?,"I knew him. I did not know him well, but I did know him."
Is Mr. Johnston still employed at Philip Morris USA?,No.
Did he retire many years ago?,"Yes, in the '90s."
Did Myron Johnston work in the Marketing Department at Philip Morris USA?,"No, he worked in Richmond, Virginia."
"Did he have any role in dictating the company's advertisi strategy with respect to the marketing and ng of Marlboro or any other cigarette brand? He did not. Where, where physically was the marketing department located located? the same located? demograph demograph In New York. i back in the 1970s and '80s and '90s? In New York City. \ And where was Mr. Johnston physically In Richmond, Virginia. I Okay. So he wasn't physically located in place where marketing and market research were No. \ You mentioned that Myron Johnston was a er. And, again, briefly explain what a er is. It's someone who studies demographics, so l they study population information. And, for example, \ an exampl e might be a demographer would look at census I information and look at if the U.S. population is i growing a you know, nd if it's growing in what age groups or by, ji in what parts of the country, things of that I type. And then you study other facts and those : analysis of information to provide information to provide insights.",
"Now based on your experience at Philip Morris, why would a demographer like Mr. Johnston be interested in the smoking rates of people under 18?",
You can answer.,Because it would be a way to forecast the size of the industry so the size of the tobacco category going forward. It would be a way to help forecast the size of the Philip Morris brands in the future and --
"And so can you explain why would Philip Morris, why would it be important to Philip Morris to forecast or understand better the size of the cigarette market in five years or ten years down the road?","Same as the reason it's important to almost any large corporation, because they need to create manufacturing centers. They need to lease buildings. They need to hire employees. They need to buy raw materials to produce the products they make. So it's part of the planning process. 4 Q. Okay. And in some of the documents that Mr. Bigger showed you, does Mr. Johnston state that he's interested in the data and this information because of its utility for forecasting?"
"Now I think this point was made pretty clear. But in Mr. Bigger's questions. But Mr. Johnston never conducted his own research at Philip Morris with smokers under the age of 18, did he?","That's correct, he did not."
"Okay. As you pointed out to Mr. Bigger, the data that Mr. Johnston discusses in all the memos that we've talked about here today come from outside sources like the Federal Government and universities and public health authorities, right?",That's correct.
Now who ultimately at Philip Morris set the policy on what the minimum age of the target audience was for Philip Morris's cigarette brand marketing and advertising?,Senior management. 0 Q. Was Mr. Johnston ever senior management at Philip Morris USA?
And based on your experience with the 4 company did Mr. Johnston have any role in setting the company's policy on what the minimum age was for the target audience for its cigarette brand advertising and marketing?,He did not.
"Now let's go back. We mentioned earlier that the time frame of this deposition goes back to the 1940s, right?",Right.
"Mr. Bigger asked you some questions about events that took place, I believe, in either the late 1940s or early 1950s; is that correct?",Yes.
Who is Johnny?,"Johnny was a representative of the Philip Morris brand. He was an individual who was a page, and he promoted the Philip Morris brand of cigarettes for the company."
"Let me pause you there just so it's clear. Philip Morris was at one point in time a brand of cigarettes that was manufactured and sold by Philip 0 Morris, the company, right?",That's correct.
So we're talking he was a spokesperson for a particular brand of cigarettes sold by the Philip 4 Morris company?,That's correct.
"And that brand is no longer sold by the company, is it?",That's right. It's no longer sold by the company.
"Mr. Bigger showed you a handwritten document written by an individual named Gus Wayne. And just so we're clear, I think what you said was Gus Wayne was a Johnny, Jr. So just briefly so everyone no one's confused, what's the difference between who Johnny was and who the Johnny, Jrs. were?","Okay. Johnny was the spokesperson for the brand that achieved almost like a celebrity status. And he was the gentleman who would yell ""Call For Philip Morris"" in perfect pitch, and he was used in commercial advertising. So he would appear in print media. There would be photographs of Johnny or perhaps on a as a in a commercial on television. Johnny, Jrs. were used at a more local level. And they were individuals who were similar to Johnny, almost like Johnny like, and they would appear in various areas in the country. They were not part of the broader commercial communications."
"Okay. And is it your understanding that 4 Gus Wayne was a Johnny, Jr. who made some public appearances in an effort to promote the Philip Morris brand of cigarettes?",Yes.
"Okay. Mr. Bigger showed you a handwritten document written by Gus Wayne suggesting that Johnny, Jr. should hand out chocolate cigarettes to children. You recall that, right?",I do.
You think the idea of handing out chocolate cigarettes to children was a good idea?,I think it's a terrible idea.
In your experience in a company the size of Philip Morris do some people come up with bad ideas?,
"Now did you see any adver Let me ask it this way. Did you look to see if Philip Morris, anybody at Philip Morris, the VP of sales who received 0 that note from Gus Wayne or anybody else at Philip Morris took Mr. Wayne's suggestion and manufactured 2 chocolates cigarettes to be handed out to children?","No, I've not seen evidence that that happened. I've seen evidence to the contrary. 5 Q. During the same period of time, have you seen other instances in correspondence where the company particularly took steps to make sure that Johnny or Johnny, Jr. wasn't used in a way that appealed to youth and people under the age of 18?"
"Let me show you this. We're going to mark Exhibit, defense Exhibit Number 1, this is a July 21st, 1949 letter to Miss Milbrath.",
Do you have what we've marked as defense Exhibit Number 1?,
That's Number 1 there.,Okay.
"So we'll give you the we'll give you marked version, yeah. Brent had it right the first time. Okay. Can you can you confirm for me, Miss Bonhomme, that this is a July 21st, 1949 letter from Ray Jones to, I think it's S.K. Milbrath?",Yes.
You understand this to be a letter in response to a consumer letter sent into the company?,"That's my understanding, yes."
"Okay. And let me read this along with you. First paragraph, ""We appreciate your suggestion that we supply Miss Patricia Milbrath with, quote, 'Call For Philip Morris' insignia to be sewn on Johnny uniforms."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes. \
"Okay. It then goes on to say, ""We find ourselves unable to comply with the suggestion. Our two reasons: One, we have made a policy to discontinue furnishing uniforms or parts of uniforms due to the expense involved and/or inability to control the use to which this material is part "" "" is put after it has been received."" Correct?",Correct.
"Now let me focus you on this next part. It says, ""Secondly, we question the wisdom of permitting children, in this case, to become walking advertisements for our brand of cigarettes."" Did I read that correctly?",Yes. j
"And he goes on to say, ""We hope that you will understand our position and explain it satisfactorily to Miss Milbrath.""",Yes. :
You see that?,I see that.
"Is this an example of the company it's, I think, three years earlier than the first letter that Mr. Bigger showed you, but in that same period of time ; the late '40s, early 1950s making an effort to make sure that Johnny or Johnny, Jr. was not used in way that might appeal to people under the age of 18 and youth in general?","Yes, it is. \ (Defense Exhibit No. 2 for i.d.) j;"
"Let me show you what we will mark as deposition Exhibit Number 2. Well, let me hand you this one.",
You have what's been marked as Exhibit Number 2?,Yes.
"Okay. This is a July 22, 1954 letter from James Bowling to a Mrs. James G. Partridge. Do you see that?",Yes.
And the tenor of the letter is essentially that Miss Partridge has asked Mr. Bowling whether Philip Morris will participate in and be a part of a homecoming celebration to occur at a school; is that right?,Yes.
"And let's take a look at the third paragraph. Mr. Bowling writes back in part, ""Unfortunately, we will be unable to give you any direct assistance because of a strict ruling which prohibits any company action which might possibly be construed by others as an attempt on our part to influence and/or connect children with the promotion cigarettes. We will, therefore, be unable to comply with your request."" See that?",Yes.
"Okay. This is dated July the 22nd, 1954, right?",Yes.
"And I believe this is about a year or so after a number of the it's actually about six months after a number of the letters that Mr. Bigger showed you when he was asking you questions about Johnny and Johnny, Jr., right?",Correct.
"Okay. Have you seen any indication in either the documents that Mr. Bigger has shown you or any of the other documents you've reviewed from that period of time that Philip Morris was using Johnny or Johnny, Jr. to try to market its cigarettes to young people under the age of 18?",
"Okay. In the information you've been provided about Barbara Lourie's smoking history, have you seen any indication that Miss Lourie ever smoked Philip Morris brand cigarettes?","Yes, I saw that she smoked Philip Morris brand cigarettes in the mid in the 1970s when she was approximately 30-years old."
"I'm sorry. And I wasn't clear. I mean, the 4 brand of cigarettes known as Philip Morris, did she ever smoke the brand of cigarettes known as Philip Morris?",Oh r no. !;
"Later in the 1970s she smoked a Philip Morris brand of cigarettes, Marlboro Red?",Marlboro Red. \
I just wanted to clear up that confusion.,Okay. j
"All right. Now if we were to move forward, if we were to move forward we were talking about a correspondence from 1949 and 1954. Have you seen other instances in the 1960s, for example, where Philip Morris made attempts to limit its cigarette brand advertising and marketing to adult smokers 18 and older?",Yes. \
Now Mr. Bigger talked to you about a CBS news program called The Teenage Smoker. You recall those questions?,Yes. \
A few years after that in 1964 did Philip Morris adopt something called The Cigarette Advertising Code?,Yes. \
Okay. Are you familiar with The Cigarette Advertising Code?,"Yes, I am. j="
Did it include restrictions that were designed to try to prevent cigarette advertising from having the an unintended appeal to people under the age of 18?,Yes. It had a number of components in order j to try to reduce exposure by young people to i cigarettes . ji
Okay. And was that adopted by Philip Morris in 1964?,Yes. \
"Okay. We're going to switch gears here, Miss Bonhomme. And there was a particular document that Mr. Bigger showed you from, I believe it was 1976. It was Excuse me. I misspoke. It's dated September 12, 1974. It was a memo written by a James Spector to a Mr. R. Fitzmaurice. Do you recall that document?",". I d o , y e s ."
I think for the record it's PT05054.,Yes.
"Okay. And just the re: line says, Marlboro Menthol analysis, Grand Rapids. And I want to just ask you a couple of quick questions about this document. Having read the document, what was it can you tell us what was going well, let me ask it this way. What was happening in Grand Rapids that sort of grabbed the attention of Mr. Spector?","Marlboro Menthol had a strong share in Grand Rapids. And Marlboro Menthol was a very very low share brand nationwide, so the Grand Rapids market was very unusual. It was a unique market. And they the market share for the brand was way out of proportion with the brands market share in the rest of the country."
"Okay. So the events that were well, let 0 me ask it this way. Based upon, did you review the charts that were attached to that document?",I did.
What do those charts tell us about whether 4 what was happening in Grand Rapids in 1974 was representative of what was happening everywhere else around the United States with respect to Marlboro Green?,"Well, Grand well, Grand Rapids was an anomaly. It was not indicative of the brand's performance in the rest of the country, so it was an odd market. And Jim Spector went out there to see why."
"Okay. And then so that's what prompted, if I'm understanding correctly, because the market share was an anomaly in Grand Rapids, that's what prompted Mr. Spector to go see what was happening there because it was out of keeping with what was happening with that brand of cigarettes everywhere else around the country?",That's correct.
"All right. Now this memo does reflect the fact that some proprietors of convenience stores commented to Mr. Spector that they believe that teenagers were buying Marlboro Menthol cigarettes, right?","That's right. 0 Q. Now if we go into if we move from this point of time from the late, the mid 1970s into the 1980s and 1990s, does Philip Morris begin to become more aggressive in terms of trying to aid retailers and 4 other retail outlets who sell cigarettes in how to enforce age restriction laws on the sale of cigarettes?"
"Okay. And not to sort of hold you to a particular year, these programs, It's The Law, We Card Action Against Access, these are programs that Philip Morris adopted and promoted in the 1980s and 1990s?",That's correct.
"All right. Am I correct, though, that the goal essentially was to assist retailers in enforcing the law so as not to sell cigarettes to people who are minors? 0 A. Yes.",
"And in your work with the Youth Smoking 2 Prevention Program, did you attempt to monitor whether those programs were successful in helping retailers 4 minimize the extent to which minors were able to 5 purchase cigarettes? 0 j",Yeah. We attempted to get feedback on the | programs and revise materials and improve them as we | came up with ideas on how to do that and expand the | reach of those programs and the depth of those | 5 programs.
And did Philip Morris voluntarily adopt or institute these retail programs? 8 A. Yes.,
And why? Why was it important to Philip Morris that they do these things.,"Because they recognized they had a role to | play in reducing youth smoking rates, and they thought I we had the unique ability to influence the retailer, I that there were many organizations working to encourage | kids not to smoke and to reduce smoking rates. But we I thought we had the relationship with the retailers so | that we could execute programs that would communicate | the importance to the general public and to retailers | 19 about the seriousness of this issue. 0 MR. GERAGHTY: Okay. You know what? Let's f take a short two-minute break. I may be done. I I'm probably going to cut several things here, | 23 but just give me two minutes to double-check 4 that. |"
And you were also asked some questions about | her smoking of Philip Morris brands. Do you recall that?,Yes. |
You said that you received some information to review in that regard; is that right?,"Yes, I heard I some information was | reviewed with me, yes. |"
"Right. And I was going to try and break that up a little bit. One time I think you said you heard some information. Another time you said you saw I some information, I thought. 15 A. No, no, I Q_. Did you receive any deposition transcripts to actually review?","No, I did not. I"
Okay. All right. So you didn't read any 0 deposition transcripts from this case?,I didn't read them. I heard some of the I 22 information from
Okay. 4 A. documents. I 5 Q. Someone communicated information from the d e p o s i t i o n s t o you?,Y e s .
Is that right?,Yes.
"Okay. And as part of that, I think one of the people who was mentioned was Miss Lourie's husband or widower, Jim Lourie?","Yes, Mr. Lourie was mentioned, yes."
"Mr. Lourie. Okay. No one who spoke with you, though, talked to you about Miss Linda Schneider?",No.
You haven't heard that name before?,No.
No one spoke with you about the fact that Ms. Schneider and Miss Lourie were friends as children?,No.
"Okay. So to the extent that Miss Schneider has talked about Mrs. Lourie's first smoking experiences with her at the age of 12, you don't have 0 any information about that?",No.
"And, likewise, to the extent that Ms. Schneider has talked about the fact that the girls, 4 what she the word she used was ""caged"" or ""caged,"" took cigarettes from their parents to smoke, you don't know about that?",
Okay.,"But I didn't ask specifically where did that I information come from, whose deposition provided that \ information."
Okay.,I didn't think to ask that. j;
"But you were told that Ms. Lourie, at least at the age of 12, she was sneaking cigarettes from her i; parents?",Yes. I
You were told that?,Yeah. I don't know exactly what age but that she was I
"Right. Well, the",that she I
"Okay. As part of your work in youth smoking prevention that Mr. Geraghty asked you about, I presume you had an opportunity to review different Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health and some of the conclusions of those Surgeon General's reports?",I had the opportunity to review them. I can't say that I have too much of a recollection of which ones and what I may have -- may have reviewed of those reports.
"Well, do you recall that's 1994, or do you recall ever coming to understand that the 1994 Surgeon General's report was specifically on youth smoking or smoking amongst teens and children and adolescence?","Yes, I remember that."
"Okay. I assume in your work with youth smoking prevention you would have at least been familiar with that Surgeon General's report, if not 0 others?",Yes. And I would have reviewed portions of it. Maybe the whole report. I don't remember specifically. I reviewed so much information in that positioning.
Do you recall reading in that report that the Surgeon General's conclusion was that nine out of ten smokers began smoking by age 18?,
"If that fact is in the 1994 Surgeon General's report with regard to the number of smokers that begin smoking by age 18, would you challenge the Surgeon General's conclusion?",
"Sure. We just this is an issue we've discussed about whether or not most smokers begin smoking by the time they turn 18. And, you know, with regard to the fact that you did spend so much time in the youth smoke prevention division in the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, I just want to know if you're 1 familiar and you recall that the Surgeon General's report has specific findings on that exact issue.",I
"No, I appreciate your clarification.","-- but just to be clear. And I don't remember the details of that report. Yes, I remember it was focused on the topic of youth smoking, and, yes, I remember that there were statistics about when kids initiate smoking. But I don't remember what data was used and how it was reported, so I can't really speak to it as I'm sitting here."
"Well, let's assume assume for me that the Surgeon General's report in 1994 says that nine out of ten smokers started smoking by the age of 18. And if you if the assumption is going to be objected to by counsel, I'm happy to pull it up on my iPad. I can 4 show you the document, I can show you the data on the website. We can go and visit it.",
"Okay. And that's fine. I don't want you to feel like the information is somehow unsubstantiated if that's the concern. In other words, if you're just if you're not sure that that's what the Surgeon General's report concluded.","Oh, no, I will believe that you're properly : stating it. \"
"Okay. All right. So believing that I'm properly stating what the Surgeon General's report concluded that nine out of ten regular smokers started by the age of 18, does Philip Morris challenge that conclusion by the Surgeon General with regard to what we've talked about earlier that there's different data sources and that it depends on what you mean by started, and some of the things we've talked about earlier?","Yeah, the Marketing Department was in New York City, the Marketing Research Department was in New York City."
Right.,"And the R&D operation was in Richmond, Virginia. I mean, we talked to each other if that's what... probably worked in different areas."
Let me show you so this is a PT3405 that we marked for the record.,Yes.
"And just look at that first page there at the bottom. There's some you know, there's names. I think we talked about those earlier. But look at those names. And do you see after the names that are 0 on the right-hand side there's a little parenthetical and it says NYO?",Yes.
Does that stand for New York office?,"Yes, it does."
"Okay. So that document was sent to, at least bwo individuals in the New York office, right? That's correct. Okay. So even if Mr. Johnston was working in Richmond, it got to New York? Yes. All right. We also talked about the fact that there was Mr. Johnston wasn't in senior management, at least not to your, not that you were aware, right ? for Philip Morris? Yes. Dr. Seligman was in senior management, Excuse me. Dr. Seligman, he was a senior management individual? senior Yes, he was a senior executive, yes. James Morgan was an individual involved in management ? At various times in his career, yes. Eventually became president? That's correct. And Joe Cullman was involved in senior management ? That's correct. So was Hugh Cullman?",That's correct. i
"And those are all other individuals we've talked about today in various documents we've looked at, right?",Yes. j
"The Action Against Access and the We Card programs that you mentioned, and there was one included in that group, too",It's The Law.
"It's The Law. Okay. And forgive me, but I don't know the answer to It's The Law, but I believe Action Against Access and the We Card program, those were not around in the 1980s?",That's correct.
Those didn't start until about the middle of the 1990s?,Right. j
"Okay. It's The Law, is that the one that was around in the '80s?",Yes. ;
"Okay. So It's the Law was around in the 1980s, but Action Against Access and We Card, those programs were not implemented or adopted by Philip Morris until the mid 1990s?",That's correct. :
All right. The Cigarette Advertising Code you were asked about in,Yes. |;
"there was nothing like that before that you're aware of, was there?",That's correct. ;
"Okay. One of these documents Mr. Geraghty showed you about Johnny, Jr., I think it was defense 2, the one from Mrs. James Partridge, is that 2?",
"Okay. Let me just have you got you've probably got it there, right?",Do you have your copy?
I do have a copy. Do you have a copy of it?,"Oh, I thought I did. Do you have 2? j"
I don't think so.,"Oh, I have it. j"

The letter from Mrs. Partridge to Mr. Bowling?,Yes.
Or to the company?,Yes.
"Okay. Do you remember what he says, ""Your idea is a very unique and clever one.""",Yes. It was to put a badge on homecoming uniforms.
