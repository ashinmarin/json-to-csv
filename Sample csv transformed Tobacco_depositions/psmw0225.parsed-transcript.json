With regard to corporate rep deposition for specifically Duval U.S. LEGAL SUPPORT James Figlar January 12, 2016 10.

Reynolds developed called Premier which is a heat mount burn product. So I think to answer your guestion, it would be yes.

It was certainly less ambiguous, less scientific in. the way it was trying to describe its position. Prior to that,. R. J.

A1 It's, it's not so much I mean, it's a disagreement from a scientific and subtle point. .15 What, what was,, what was, what was problematic for the 16.. tobacco companies are the things that were lacking in terms of scientific information that would have in the old days prior to '64 been required to establish cause and effect relationships Were very important to know from a tobacco and cigarette design perspective. So for instance, if you don't know what the causative agents are in cigarette smoke or in tobacco that are driving the propagation of certain diseases, then the 2.4 tobacco industry has no way to know what it is that they should try to take out. So that was important U.S. LEGAL SUPPORT James Figlar January 12, 2 016 and that information was lacking. Another piece.of information that was lacking is an understanding of how cancers formed. If you don't understand how the mechanism by which the disease manifests itself in. humans, then again, you don't know .what those things might you be doing to cause that. And then finally, and I think'most importantly, was the lack .of a reliable animal model that scientists and the tobacco industry and. others could use to test -alternative' designs for cigarettes. So no one had been able to establish either laryngeal cancer or.lung cancer in an animal with the direct exposure. So there's no animal model even today where we can generate lung cancer in a, in a mouse or a -^ or any other animal. So you have no model that you can use that you can test alternative designs. So those kind of things which as I said before in the old days were kind of the milestones that you had to have in place before you could say something definitively caused a disease, those things were lacking and remained lacking for. a very long period of time. Q_ Well, were those things which you say were lacking the basis for the tobacco industry disputing the health charge and encouraging smokers to continue smoking? U.S. LEGAL SUPPORT James Figlar.

Certainly, that was the way causeand' effect relationships were established prior to '64 and let's be. fair. What --the Surgeon General was very clear in the '64 Surgeon General's report that there were, that there were lines of evidence that were not available but what the Surgeon General was, was U.S. LEGAL SUPPORT ; James Figler January 12, 2016 . ; 5.1' concerned about is that the weight of the public health problem justified making the statements that, that they made, at that time so that the public health community could take action.
