Of course, you understand that Bowman Gray in 1964 agreed that there was a statistical association between smoking and lung cancer. So Reynolds has been aware of what the data is and understood what the potential meaning of that data was. And again, what we did to our products worked under the operating premise that certainly smoking could be dangerous."

So, therefore, you were offering up a completely new hypothesis in '64 on how to determine the causal link to disease. And certainly by that break of convention Reynolds did not agree that had been fully established, but they certainly knew what those statistical associations were and that was one, that that potentially would be one piece of evidence that could provide cause and effect."
