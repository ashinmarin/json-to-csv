                        "answer": "So when the President signed into law the FSPTCA, it gave FDA broad regulatory authority over the company Philip Morris USA and products it makes. But it generally can be categorized into they have regulatory authority over the design of our cigarettes, manufacturing of our cigarettes, marketing of our cigarettes, as well as sales."

                        "question": "Can you describe what the FDA has done in its regulation of the design of Philip Morris USA's cigarettes?",
                        "answer": "Amongst other things, and specifically around the design of the cigarettes, there are several regulating authorities. And I generally for example, with the cigarette design, we would have to report to FDA the ingredients that we put in our cigarettes. We also have to report the levels of the constituents, harmful and potentially harmful constituents that are emitted from our cigarettes. In the design space, FDA also has broad authority over establishing product standards so they can, for example, regulate levels of tar and nicotine, if they deem it appropriate for the protection of public health. Also important to the cigarette design, FDA has required manufacturers to inform them if there are any changes that we make to our product. And depending on the levels of changes, the FDA has carved out three kind of pathways that they would review the scientific evidence. So if we change the products a little bit, it will probably go through a substantial equivalence to demonstrate we have a substantial equivalence. If not, we have to submit the scientific evidence around a new product application. And there is a substantial level of evidence that we would have to provide to demonstrate that it's appropriate for the protection of public health. And the third pathway, which is to demonstrate if we have a product that is lower risk, that's called a modified risk tobacco product application. And, once again, we have to submit evidence to FDA to get authorization to put these products on the market. So, bottom line, we now have to inform FDA and get permission and authorization from FDA if we make any changes in the cigarette design."

                        "answer": "With manufacturing, one of the first things that we have to do is register the manufacturing facilities with FDA on an annual basis. And FDA can come and inspect these facilities on a regular basis every two years. As a matter of fact, they have come and inspected our manufacturing facilities. Also with the manufacturing, FDA is going to establish what's called good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, to establish kind of a common set of standards for not only us, but for others in the industry."

                        "answer": "Specifically around marketing, FDA has jurisdiction and enforces regulating authority, starting by banning the use of descriptors, like \"lights\" and \"mild.\" And, you know, for marketing, it also has authority over our marketing research. They can ask us to produce our consumer research. Along with that, they also can ask us to produce documents related to the health effects, any studies that we have done on the products. Furthermore, with the marketing in the marketing space, they have the authority to also look at the graphic warnings and the warnings on our products. And they have, you know, imposed a new set of warnings for cigarettes."

                        "answer": "What I was specifically referring to is that FDA, as soon as the law was signed and had the imposed its enforcement, it gave the manufacturer two years to stop making cigarettes with any descriptors, like \"lights\" or \"ultra light\" or \"mild,\" or any descriptors that distinguish the taste profile of the cigarettes."

                        "answer": "With that, too, FDA has a broad enforcement authority. And amongst other things, they restrict the sale to minors. It's illegal to sell to minors. They have imposed regulations around, you know, the sale should be behind the counter and face-to-face interactions and, also, you know, banned the use of the brand names for any sponsored events, et cetera."

                        "answer": "Yes. As I mentioned earlier, they can ask manufacturers not only to provide the specific information about the ingredients and constituents, but also require to disclose documents on health related issues around products as well as m a r k e t i n g ."

                        "answer": "Yes, indeed. As we were talking about a minute ago, that FDA has already conducted inspections of our manufacturing facilities."

                    {
                        "question": "Can you describe a typical inspection at a Philip Morris USA facility?",
                        "answer": "Yes. It's actually an interesting scenario, because they just show up at our doorstep unannounced. And usually it's a team of inspectors that are deployed and, you know, they just knock on our door. And we have to open up the manufacturing facility and provide to them any supporting documents that they deem necessary for them to conduct the inspections. And these inspections are very thorough. And they go through and walk through our manufacturing facilities, they review our standard operating procedures, and in some instances, they can stay on site as long as they've gotten all the questions answered. So in this instance, they stayed at the Philip Morris USA manufacturing facility for almost a week."

                        "answer": "Yes, indeed. So, you know, FDA has broad ranging enforcement authority and, you know, we have to comply with that. Otherwise, there are consequences."

                        "question": "What consequences or enforcement tools does the FDA have available to it?",
                        "answer": "Amongst other things, as we've talked about, if they are doing an inspection, let's say if they find anything amiss, they can shut down the factory. And at the other end, if there are any issues with the products, they can ask manufacturers to recall the products. They can even ask manufacturers to provide samples of the products. And in some instances, there are stiff penalties. And remember I was mentioning to you about the sales piece. At the sales point of sales, if the stores are found to be selling products to minors without evidence or proof of age, there are stiff penalties associated with the store owners as well. So they have very broad ranging enforcement authorities and they exercise that on a regular basis."

                        "answer": "So when the bill was enacted, one of the first things that the FDA did was set up the Center for Tobacco Products. The Center for Tobacco Products then assessed what's called user fees. And these user fees are based on market sales and proportion sales for each manufacturer. So the Center for Tobacco Products was built upon or based on the user fees."

                        "answer": "Yes. Yes. Right now FDA has got close to 500 employees and all the infrastructure that's been created around the Center for Tobacco Products is supported through the user fees that Philip Morris USA and other manufacturers pay."

                        "answer": "Generally speaking, we were very interested in developing reduced-harm products and we wanted to be able to have a regulatory framework to assess those reduced-harm products. As a matter of fact, that was one of the main reasons that we were, you know, encouraging FDA regulation. And even as early as the bill was being signed, our CEO, Mr. Szymanczyk sent a letter to the President in support of this regulation. You know, in addition to this framework for assessing these lower-risk products, we also wanted to have a common set of high standards for manufacturing and furthermore also allow FDA to develop for, you know, clear communication to the consumers about the health effects of our products."

And we have a range of different products that we have on the market. And we design the cigarettes to meet those sensory experiences of the different smokers. So, you know, of course, when you are combusting cigarettes, tar and nicotine comes in the cigarette and it can fall wherever it may be.

So we make cigarettes that are full flavored cigarettes and we make cigarettes that are, you know, light cigarettes. Of course, we don't have those descriptors anymore, as we discussed earlier. But different consumers prefer different types of products. And we make a range of products that meet those sensory expectations."

                        "answer": "So just going back to the work that we had been doing in this space of incorporating technologies for general exposure reduction, over the years we have had different products with different levels of inclusions of the different technologies, like ventilation holes, porous paper, expanded tobacco, et cetera. And that has resulted in a range of different cigarettes. And people have kind of developed sensory expectations around those different ranges of products that we have. So we have somebody who likes to smoke a full flavor cigarette and we have others who would like to smoke the smoke experience that comes out of, say, an ultra-light or a light cigarette. So that kind of broadly describes the type of sensory expectations that people are used to getting from the cigarette, and that's what I meant. We have a range of products for consumer to choose from and they make the choice to use one cigarette over the other."

                        "answer": "The way I would characterize that, smokers smoke cigarettes for a number of reasons. Nicotine may be one of the reasons. I can't tell you. But I can definitely tell you when a smoker smokes cigarettes, they have certain expectations. When we design our cigarettes, we make sure that we meet the taste and sensorial expectations.

                        "answer": "You know, in general terms, there are many factors that play a role in why a smoker smokes a cigarette. As I told you, we believe and we design our cigarettes to meet their taste and sensorial expectations. And there's been research done on this. A smoker may smoke because they like the social aspect of congregating with other smokers. They may like a certain brand, a certain flavor, a certain mouth feel. Some smokers just like the notion of the hand-to-mouth motion, the smoke coming out from their mouth. As I said, the whole smoking behavior is a complex phenomenon.

Explain that, please.",
                        "answer": "Well, you have to realize that cigarette, by definition, consists of tobacco wrapped in paper with a filter on it, in the simplest form, and tobacco has nicotine in it. When we designed our cigarettes, we make sure that we make the highest quality cigarette that consistently delivers a taste and sensory experience. So because there is nicotine in the tobacco, you do get nicotine from it. But when we design, we pay attention to the taste and sensory experience."

Having said that, nicotine does have a response and could be one of the constituents.

And these are constituents that we measure after, you know, testing the cigarettes through standardized conditions. And I believe that I said this earlier, the ingredients we were reporting to the Center for Disease Control since 1985, before FDA had the regulatory authority. I believe we were reporting the levels of constituents. They were not at that time classified the way FDA has classified them, as HPHC. I'm abbreviating harmful and potentially harmful constituents. We were reporting levels of constituents to I believe the Massachusetts Department of Health and the Texas Authority. I don't know how long that was going on, but that was one of the reporting publications that we had."

You know, one of the things that once the law came into order, the FDA, according to law, would require and we have submitted close to Trade Secret substantially equivalent applications on products that were considered that would be under the regulatory authority and were not grandfathered. And therefore we submitted all the evidence and we are in the process of getting them reviewed. And FDA has come up with a number of questions and we are responding to those questions to allow them to make a determination whether they have sufficient information to then decree an order of whether the product is substantially equivalent or not substantially equivalent.

So any 16 changes that we have made to our products since are deemed to be regulated. And we would have to submit information if they're different than the ones that have been in the market before 2007.

I think it was up until sometime in 2011, was it not?",
                        "answer": "I don't remember the specific year and date. But generally speaking, any product that we have on the market since 2009, I think you are partially correct, that there were some products that we could put on the market, but we had to develop the scientific evidence and submit a substantially equivalent application. And if FDA reviews it and finds that these products are not substantially equivalent to our predicate product, then we would have if they're on the market, we would have to pull them off the market, because that's FDA jurisdiction and the regulatory authority to force manufacturers to remove products from the market if they're deemed to be non-substantially equivalent."

                        "answer": "I think that's generally correct, that, you know, manufacturers had the ability to put products on the market but also submit the substantial equivalent. But the important part is we had to submit the substantial equivalent application and once FDA reviewed those substantial equivalent applications and deem them to be non-substantially equivalent, then manufacturers have to pull that product from the market. And there are actually several examples where FDA has been making rulings on products and have asked have deemed some products to be non-substantially equivalent."

                        "answer": "I don't want to speculate. You see, the thing is with this under this new regulatory authority, any small change that we make, we have to inform the FDA and FDA needs to make a determination whether it's accepted. Just to give you an example, if we have a vendor that is supplying certain ingredients and if that vendor changes, we have to inform the FDA even if it's exactly the same ingredient but now we are buying it from a different vendor. So pretty much anything that we do during the design phase that changes what was being done before, we have to inform the FDA and they have to review.

There are different levels of HPHC in the products that we have submitted for substantial equivalence.

We constantly have been trying to figure out new, innovative ways of lowering the risk profile of our cigarettes. And the project that I worked on in the 2000s was around using activated carbon in our filters to absorb some of the harmful constituents. Another project that we were working on was an electrically heated cigarette system that, you know I was personally involved in developing the testing and determining how we would evaluate these products, which goes back to what was the main reason why we wanted FDA regulation, was that we wanted a regulatory body to provide us with the framework so that we can develop the scientific evidence, the regulatory body can review the scientific evidence, and then we can provide clear and honest communication to the consumers about either the risk reduction or exposure reduction to these different constituents. And those are the products that we have worked on beyond just the general exposure reduction."

And if we have to communicate that there's an exposure reduction or risk reduction, those are the two pathways for modified risk tobacco products that we can then communicate to the consumer.

Do you agree or disagree with that finding?",

But let me try and summarize as briefly as I can on some of the strengths and limitations of the different types of clinical trial study designs. You know, when you're trying to directly assess the changes in exposure when smokers switch from one cigarette to another, one way would be to look at cross-sectional designs, as my colleagues rightfully pointed out, where you look at the levels of exposure in smokers that are smoking those brands as their regular cigarettes. Another way to do that would be to bring in participants and switch them to the lower yield cigarettes and then monitor the exposure. That does not mean that one is better than the other. But on the contrary, what we found was that we found consistent results regardless of however you look at it, whether you do it as a switching study or as a cross-sectional study."

The reason why we always have this control group is that we want to make sure first of all, going back to the question that you asked about randomization, we make sure that the distribution of the study participants in the different groups are even, so we have an even number of males and females, an even number of cigarettes smoked, et cetera. And just the fact that they're in a clinical study environment, we like to have a control group to make sure that that kind of captures the effect of being in the study. I don't think that it's been shown one way or the other. It could go up or down, different things can happen, and that's why you want to have this control group, to account for this phenomenon. 4 BY MR. CABANISS:"

Now the reason for doing that is that in studies where there is forced switching of cigarettes, there is commonly found a reduction in the amount of smoking following the switch; right? That's why you had to have a control group of folks who were regular Marlboro Full Flavor smokers, and unbeknownst to them, they were switched but really not switched to Marlboro Full Flavor regular smokers; correct?",
                        "answer": "So let me try to understand your question. If you're saying that forced switching you said reduces the cigarette consumption, I don't think that was necessarily what's been shown one way or the other. Because as I said earlier, the reason for having this control is they could reduce or increase. They could go either way. But having the control group allows you to kind of anchor your comparisons, whatever may happen in that setting."

It says (as read), Baseline exposure investigations were performed on Day One. And at the end of that day, then the smokers or subjects were randomized into one of three groups. Group Marlboro Full Flavor, that was a control group, continued to smoke Marlboro Full Flavor cigarettes; Group ML, which stands for Marlboro Lights, switched to Marlboro Lights cigarettes; and finally Group MUL, Marlboro Page 315 I Ultra-Lights, switched to Marlboro Ultra-Light cigarettes for eight days each.

So now we have rules for this deposition, which was that you were tendering the witness to me, I was going to ask my questions, and you were going to strictly limit your questions to the scope of the questions that I asked. There were four areas to my questioning, FDA regulation, some clarification with respect to some prior testimony about addiction, some clarification about some of the employees that you asked him about, as well as two organizations, and some clarification about Dr. Sarkar's testimony with respect to the introduction dates of Marlboro Lights and Marlboro Reds.

But now we are going into the study design of a particular switching study and you are reading from the study itself if you wanted to show him the study and ask him about it, you should be sitting across the table from him and giving him a copy of it. You should not be trying to ask these questions over the phone. For one thing, it's improper to ask him about the study without giving him a copy. For another thing, it's way, way beyond the scope of anything that is permissible under the agreement that you made with Philip Morris and the other parties in this case with respect to the continuation of this deposition, which you unilaterally terminated when it first began on May 29th."

They then go on to explain every minutes, based on the maximum of 30 cigarettes over 16 hours from Baseline to Day Eight. They continue, subjects were never forced to smoke and were allowed to smoke less than their daily allotment of cigarettes, or even quit smoking at any time during this study. So the study determined how many cigarettes each smoker would get and the study took that number of cigarettes, divided it into 16 hours they were awake, for 960 minutes. And that came up with the times at which the cigarettes would be allowed to be smoked by the participants, 960 divided by 30 equals 32, every 32 minutes. Now, does that refresh your recollection?",

I would need to verify by looking at the clinical protocol as to how did they determine the maximum allowable cigarettes for the duration of the study. It was I think 120 percent of what they smoked at baseline, but I don't know the answer to that question specifically."

One was the total exposure study where we had several thousands of smokers in a cross-sectional setting and we measured the exposure as a cross-section. When I say cross-section, these were people who were using these products on a regular basis. This is a totally different study than the previous publication that you were talking about, which was a randomized clinical trial. We had two different studies. This goes back to what I was saying earlier, that it just reinforces that both of these studies, along with the evidence, showed consistently that lower yield results in lower exposure."

We would have to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to get them the scientific evidence. And we cannot communicate about lowering the risk of the product until the FDA reviews that message and approves it. So, no, we cannot communicate the lower risk profile of our smokeless products without FDA authorization.

That's the reason why FDA becomes such an important and integral part of our harm reduction efforts. And FDA we said that there were a number of products in the pipeline that we want FDA to review and make a determination whether we can communicate the lower risk trial of the different products that we are working on.

I want you to assume these statements were made. Based upon where we are today, none of those statements have been adhered to or validated or accomplished by Philip Morris; true?",

My simple question is you would have to agree, sir, that if those statements were made by representatives at the top of Philip Morris, that if they found something harmful in their cigarettes, they would reduce it; and if they couldn't not reduce, but eliminate it. And if they couldn't eliminate it, they would shut down their plants; that simply hasn't been done, has it?",
                        "answer": "You know, the first part of the question I think bears some explanation. If you look at, you know, the whole decades of research that's going on I have looked at the scientific evidence and I still don't know whether we have found the constituent or constituents that can be linked to lung cancer. And the National Cancer Institute continues to spend money on trying to understand what is it in specific that causes lung cancer. And as I said, you know, we have continued our effort over the years to try to approach this from a general exposure reduction. We have all these different programs that are in place to try to reduce it. This is not just one single chemical that you can take out and make the cigarette safer. I think the only safe cigarette is the one that's not smoked."

FDA would have to review it and make a determination of the best way to facilitate the switching from cigarettes to smokeless products. And we are approaching and in talks with FDA and making considerations of the best path forward.
