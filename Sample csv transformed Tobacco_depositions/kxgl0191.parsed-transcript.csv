Prior to 2004 were you working for Brown & Williamson?,I was.
And how long did you work for Brown & Williamson?,"I started working for Brown & Williamson in 1999, so five years."
Okay. And prior to working for Brown & Williamson who did you work for?,Just prior to Brown & Williamson I was a postdoctoral fellow at Auburn University.

So it's not part of your job duties to testify then?,"No. It is not. It's not part of my job description, no."
Okay. Why don't you tell me what your current job description is?,Sure. I'm the Vice President of Cigarette Product Development for R.J. Reynolds.
How many depositions do you give a year in regard to tobacco litigation?,"I don't know. I haven't really kept count, but there's a large number of cases in Florida. So VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY W (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 -* GO I have given a number of depositions with regard to the Engle Progeny cases."
"In the last two years, from 2008 to 2010, do you believe you've given more than a dozen depositions?",Yes.
Do you believe you've done more than 25?,"I would say so, yes."
"More than 50, do you know?",That I don't know.
Would you think it's somewhere between and 50?,"I think I have been named and I don't know if this helps you or not, but I think I've been named in 70 cases in total roughly, but I have not been deposed in all of them. So I think somewhere south of probably 40 or 50 depositions in total in the last two years."
In the last two years how much of your time has been spent on preparing for and reviewing and consulting with regard to the Engle Progeny cases?,Most of the time that I've spent on Engle Progeny has been traveling to Florida. That's the bulk of the time. Typically when preparing for a case on trial is to go a day or so ahead of the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 NI proposed trial time and spend several hours going over the particulars of the case. So it's hard for me to judge. I don't track the time that I spend.
Do you think it's more or less than percent of your time?,It's less than 50 percent of my time.
Do you think it's more or less than percent of your time?,I would say it's less than 25 percent.
Do you think it's more or less than percent of your time?,"I would say at this point it's probably somewhere around 10 percent of my time. Again, I haven't tracked it."
I understand. I'm just asking for an approximation.,That's what I would think at this point is about 10 percent of my time.
How many Engle Progeny trials have you participated in?,I don't know the number off the top of my head. I'm trying to think of how many cases. Maybe eight or nine cases.
Have you reviewed the deposition transcripts of any of any of the individuals that VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY W (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ XI were taken in the Suarez case?,X have not.
Is reviewing deposition transcripts or testimony of witnesses important for the purposes of the testimony that you offer at trial?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Sir, do you believe that cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer?",Yes. I do.
Do you believe that cigarette smoking causes COPD?,"I believe it can, yes."
Do you know what COPD means?,Yes.
Can you tell us what that means?,It's obstructive pulmonary disease.
Okay. Do you believe that cigarette smoking can cause congestive heart failure?,I believe it can.
Do you believe that cigarette smoking can cause coronary artery disease?,I believe so.
Do you believe that cigarette smoking can be addictive? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430,Yes.
"As the Vice President of Cigarette Product Development, can you tell me whether you're working on removing the addictive nature or quality of cigarettes?",I'm not quite sure what you mean. The addictive components of cigarettes is through nicotine in tobacco.
And is there a way to remove the addictive components of cigarettes from the cigarette itself?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Let me back up a little bit. As the Vice President of Cigarette Product Development for RJR, do you have an opinion as to how cigarettes are addictive or create an addiction in people?",
"(By Mr. Bauta) What have you been doing since well, let me back up a little bit. How long have you been Vice President of Cigarette Product Development?",Since 2008.
Okay. Since 2008 what have you been doing to remove nicotine from RJR cigarettes?,We have not attempted to remove nicotine from RJR cigarettes in that time frame.
Do you think it's important to make cigarettes less addictive to people who smoke them?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) And when you say it's not a viable path, what do you mean by that?",It's not a viable product development pathway. It's not something that consumers are interested in.
"So if you remove the nicotine, people wouldn't buy cigarettes; is that correct?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Do you think it is a good thing or a bad thing for cigarettes to be addictive?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, I'm just asking you as the Vice President of Cigarette Product Development for RJR whether you think it's a good thing that your product is addictive or whether you think it's a bad thing that your product is addictive?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Can I ask you to define for me what addiction means?,
(By Mr. Bauta) What is the definition that you use there at RJR when you're discussing issues of nicotine as the Vice President for Cigarette Product Development?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, have you ever used the term addiction in any meetings with any staff members or people that are working for you when you've acted as the Vice President for Cigarette Product Development?",
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, I guess I'm trying to find out from you, sir, when you use the term addiction, do you define it in these meetings or do you just assume everybody knows what addiction means?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Do you believe that a person who has a cigarette addiction is capable of quitting?,"Absolutely, yes."
Can you think of any other product that's sold in the United States legally that creates a similar addiction to that of tobacco?,"You know, I know there are debates about various types of food items that may be like that, but I don't believe that the scientific at least I'm not aware of any scientific literature that would suggest that those products are like tobacco products. Q, So you don't know of any other product VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ ro other than tobacco products that have a similar addictive nature which can be sold in the United States legally that they not aware you know, you found long time and I was couldn't * started."
And did you believe them?,"Sure, yes."
What do you recall in 1982 the cigarette warning saying?,"I believe the warnings in '82 would have said that smoking is dangerous to your health, a Surgeon General warning."
"And back when you were 17 years old, what did you interpret that to mean? Do you recall?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Did you think they could kill you?,I'm pretty sure that's what the that's what it meant.
And you believed that warning; right?,
(By Mr. Bauta) And that didn't dissuade your curiosity at all?,"It did not at that time, no."
Did there come a point in time when the warning did dissuade your curiosity?,"Not that I recall, no."
Do you know what the warnings say today?,Yes.
What do they say today?,"That there's a there's a lung cancer warning, there's a heart disease warning, there's a rotating warning that talks about contains carbon monoxide. And I believe if I'm not mistaken there is a warning for oh, no. That's I can't remember if it's pregnant women shouldn't smoke or if cigarettes are addictive."
Let me ask you,I don't have them memorized off the top of my head as I sit here.
Okay. Do you believe the warnings are true today?,Yes. I do.
And yet you continue to smoke; correct?,"I quit smoking completely in '05 for ro VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ ro ro several years. So now from time to time I will smoke on a social occasion, but I don't consider myself an active smoker and certainly I'm not an every day smoker."
Why do you smoke on occasional social occasions?,Because I enjoy it. I enjoy smoking.
"As an organic chemist, can you tell us what carbon monoxide does to the human body?",I couldn't answer that as an organic chemist because I'm an inorganic chemist.
"Oh, I'm sorry. As an inorganic chemist can you tell us what carbon monoxide does?","Carbon monoxide has a tendency to bind to hemoglobin, the iron center in hemoglobin and, therefore, displace the ability for oxygen to be picked up by hemoglobin in the blood. And specifically carbon monoxide is a stronger ligand for iron than 02 is and, therefore, has a tendency to bind up hemoglobin."
And why does that create a danger in the human body?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Are you married, sir?",I am.
Does your wife smoke?,"She does, yes."
Is she a smoker?,"Yes. She is. She's a daily smoker, yes."
How long has she been smoking?,"I haven't asked her when she started smoking, but she's smoked the whole time I've known her, so for over 15 years."
Have you advised her to quit smoking?,"We've talked about it from time to time, but I have not specifically advised her to quit."
"When you say you've talked about it from time to time, what does that mean?","Well, obviously, she knows that I've quit smoking, so we've talked about whether or not she will quit smoking or not. And she may. She's just not she's decided she's not ready to quit yet."
Do you believe she's addicted to cigarette smoking? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 j^,
(By Mr. Bauta) Is it important for you to know as her husband whether she's addicted to cigarette smoking?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Are you concerned about the possible health effects of her continued smoking?,"I mean, certainly that's possible and it does concern me, but so yeah, I mean, it would concern me."
But you haven't advised her to quit; is that correct?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Do you have any children?,I have a stepson.
Does he smoke?,"He lives in Scotland, so I don't get to see VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ^ (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ him every day. He has smoked, but I don't know that he's an active smoker right now."
Would you advise people with children to advise their children not to start smoking?,Yes.
Why would you do that?,"Well, I don't think a child is capable of making an adult decision until they're an adult or whether they're capable of weighing the risks associated with any type of behavior. Certainly smoking is a risky behavior and I would advise parents and children to not not do that risky behavior."
When do you think a person's old enough to decide whether they should start smoking?,Personally I believe when they become an adult and they have a capability of understanding what the risks are associated with that type of behavior or other types of risky behaviors to make a personal choice about what it is they're going to do.
In your mind do you have a certain age that a person is old enough or wise enough to make those decisions?,"Actually, I don't. I think the states and VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY M (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ CO the government have pretty much said that the age of adult is somewhere around 18 when you can vote. Personally I think that there are people that are wiser at a younger age and there are people that may take considerably longer to reach adult-type decisions. So X think it's highly variable from person to person."
Do you believe that the nicotine-containing cigarettes manufactured by RJR are addictive?,I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
Sure. Do you believe that the nicotine-containing cigarettes manufactured by RJR are addictive?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Has RJR ever marketed a cigarette that contained no nicotine?,"I don't know that any company has made a product that contains no nicotine, but certainly Reynolds has not made to my knowledge any cigarettes that contain no nicotine that are made of tobacco."
Okay. Do you believe that smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJR may cause lung VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY N> (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 g o cancer?,"They may, yes."
Do you believe that smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJR may cause congestive heart failure?,"I believe that is possible, yes."
Do you believe that smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJR may cause COPD?,"They may, yes."
Do you believe that cigarettes manufactured by RJR are defective or unreasonably dangerous?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Why do you not believe that they1re unreasonably dangerous?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, let me ask you this VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ^ (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 g way then: Do you believe that cigarettes are dangerous?",I believe they can be.
And what would make them dangerous?,
(By Mr. Bauta) And that's what would make them dangerous; correct?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, you're not disputing that cigarettes can cause lung cancer; right?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Okay. And we would agree VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY [O (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 w that lung cancer is not a good thing; right?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Okay. So is it fair to say then that cigarettes are a dangerous product?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Okay. Now, do you think it's a reasonably dangerous product?",
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, let me ask you this: As the Vice President of Cigarette Product Development for RJR, are you aware of a marketing term called cost benefit analysis?","I don't I don't know if that's a marketing term or not, but I think I'm generally aware of that idea."
Okay. Can you tell me what the benefits are to smoking cigarettes?,
(By Mr. Bauta) And what is the cost to the person for using for smoking cigarettes?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Well, is there a cost associated with smoking cigarettes?",
(By Mr. Bauta) And do you believe those VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY N> (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ^ risks outweigh the benefits you just mentioned?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Do you believe that RJR has made false statements of material facts with regard to cigarettes with the intention of misleading smokers?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Do you believe that RJR has concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false and misleading and failed to disclose those material facts concerning the health VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY N> (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 w effects and addictive nature of cigarette smoking?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Have you ever attended a meeting at RJR where someone recommended that cigarettes be pulled from the market, that they no longer be sold?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Can you tell me what tobacco products you've determined to be less hazardous?,"Well, not me personally, but certainly the scientific and public health community recognizes that smokeless tobacco products are significantly less hazardous than smoking by some would say greater than 90 percent. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY N) (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 w"
Have you personally ever recommended to anyone at RJR to stop selling cigarettes because of the risk to the health of the smoker?,
(By Mr. Bauta) Can you tell me what you believe to be the historical efforts by RJR to address public health concerns?,"Sure. I think I've that is often the bulk of my testimony in these cases. Certainly R.J. Reynolds has been investigating the potential links between smoking and health-related outcomes for over years. The general and, I mean, I can go into deep specifics if you want. It's a very open-ended question, but the general process at Reynolds has been understand what the what the health-related literature is suggesting, the scientific literature, understand what those hypotheses are, investigate those hypotheses, determine if they're credible and then attempt to understand whether our products either contain a constituent that may be in reference and try to reduce or remove those types of constituents. That has been the bulk of what has occurred over the last 60 years. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY w (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430"
"Well, obviously, you haven't been working for RJR for 60 years; correct?","I have not, no. I'm not 60 years old myself."
How did you find out what RJR has been doing for the last 60 years?,"Well, certainly I have read many of RJR's scientific reports that go back into the '50s."
How many of those reports can you estimate for me have you read?,I have read I would say hundreds of reports in my time. Certainly my reliance list has an awful lot of R.J. Reynolds' scientific reports on it.
When did you first start reading these reports over the last reports that encompass the last 60 years?,"Well, really much of the scientific research that I have read about tobacco products started when I began working for Brown & Williamson in 1999. There has obviously, I was not privy to internal documents from Reynolds at that time, but Reynolds as other tobacco companies publish in the scientific literature. So I was certainly aware of what's going on in the field starting in '99."
When did you determine was the first time VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY [O (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 w that you became convinced that tobacco smoking or smoking cigarettes could cause lung cancer in people?,I've never been not convinced.
When do you believe RJR was first convinced that their cigarette products could cause lung cancer in people?,"Well, I think R.J. Reynolds certainly became aware of the potential and the accusations with regard to smoking and health going back many decades. Certainly Reynolds has known about the association between cigarette smoking, the statistical association between cigarette smoking and potential health outcomes since the Surgeon General's report in '64, if not sooner than that, and certainly had debated the meaning of those statistical relationships."
"My question is when did they know for sure, not that there was some debate or not that they were questioning it, but when did RJR know for a fact that smoking RJR cigarettes could cause lung cancer",
"(By Mr, Bauta) in people? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY fO (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 5! o","I don't know how R.J. Reynolds would necessarily know that. That is certainly something that the public health community would consider to be a fact. Certainly R.J. Reynolds has a right to their scientific judgment and opinion on the matter, but at the end of the day it's people like the Surgeon General that make the public health determinations."
"Right, but you still didn't answer my question. Are you saying that RJR is still not convinced that smoking RJR cigarettes can cause lung cancer in people?",
"(By Mr. Bauta) Okay. So why don't you tell me based on your review of RJR documents when you believe that RJR knew for a fact that smoking cigarettes, smoking RJR cigarettes could cause lung cancer in people?",
(By Mr. Bauta) Let's try it a different way because you're still not answering my question. So let me try,"I apologize. Q, That's okay. We'll just work we'll try a different way. Maybe this will be helpful. Do you think today RJR knows that smoking RJR cigarettes can cause lung cancer in people?"
"(By Mr. Bauta) Do you believe the same is true in 2000, in the year 2000, that in the year RJR knew, convinced that smoking RJR cigarettes could cause lung cancer in people? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 ro",
(By Mr. Bauta) Did they know it could cause lung cancer?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Okay. How about in 1990? Do you believe that in 1990 RJR knew, was convinced that smoking people smoking RJR cigarettes were at risk of lung cancer?",
"(By Mr. Bauta) And by major risk factor, are you saying that they knew in 1990 that smoking RJR cigarettes could cause lung cancer in people?","I think the corporate position for Reynolds was that they recognized that certainly there was a risk associated with developing that disease. I think they would still not be completely convinced that all the scientific data was there to proclaim VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 u> cause and effect, but certainly they understood that there would be an increase in risk."
At what point in time do you believe that there was all the scientific data necessary to give cause and effect to cigarette smoking causing lung cancer in people?,"I don't know that I could necessarily put a time frame on it. I think certainly the data, the scientific data has increased since the 1960s and certainly it's cigarettes are one of the most, if not the most heavily studied commercially available product. If you read the 2004 Surgeon General's report, you would understand that there are that in saying causes a disease what you're trying to do is make a public health assessment judgment. And certainly that's what the Surgeon General does. And if you read that language that talks about cigarette smoking and its related health outcomes, you would know that it says there's scientific data sufficient enough to make a causal relationship. So there is certainly an accumulation of data that has to occur and when that is is dependent upon really the folks making that evaluation."
Do you believe that a manufacturer of a VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ^ (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 J product has a responsibility to make the evaluation of whether or not their product is capable of causing disease in people?,
"(By Mr. Bauta) Do you believe RJR has all the scientific data necessary today in 2010 to make the link, the causal link between their cigarette products and lung cancer in people?","Again, I think I've said before that Reynolds believes that cigarette smoking can cause disease and certainly says that on its website. We don't certainly dispute those those arguments."
"Does Reynolds also believe that there's sufficient data today in 2010, scientific data to VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY ro (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 Ol establish that cigarettes cause disease that can result in death of people?","I believe we do, yes."
Do you know when RJR first became aware that there was sufficient scientific evidence to support causation between RJR cigarettes and lung cancer in people?,Certainly RJR has been aware of the smoking and related associations between cigarette smoking and disease at any given time. It's a question of whether or not did R.J. Reynolds agree with that or whether or not they felt that there was sufficient evidence to make statements is a is not the same.
Right. And that's why I'm asking you when did they first agree that there was sufficient evidence to make a causal link between lung cancer and smoking RJR cigarettes?,
(By Mr. Bauta) So you're thinking 2000?,"I believe in terms of what our corporate position was, I would say that that is when we would have put that on the website. Of course, you understand that Bowman Gray in 1964 agreed that there was a statistical association between smoking and lung cancer. So Reynolds has been aware of what the data is and understood what the potential meaning of that data was. And again, what we did to our products worked under the operating premise that certainly smoking could be dangerous."
Would you agree with me that in 1964 RJR disputed what the risk was between smoking and lung cancer?,
"I think I'm almost done. If you can give me one second here? Dr. Figlar, have you reviewed the designation of your testimony that has been filed in the Suarez case?","I would say I'm not quite sure what you mean by designation, but yes. I believe I have. In other words, what my I forgot what the terminology that I would call it is, but what my disclosure is. Sorry."
Right. Essentially a summary of your opinions?,Yes. I have.
Okay. And is that the basis of what you believe your testimony will be in the Suarez case?,"It will, yes."
Are you going to be offering any testimony VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY fO (212) 279-9424 www.veritext.com (212) 490-3430 that's specific to Mr. Suarez?,"You know, I don't know what you may necessarily ask me about Mr. Suarez on the stand, but no, nothing specific."
