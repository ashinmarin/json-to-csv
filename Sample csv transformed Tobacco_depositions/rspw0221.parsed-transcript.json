                        "answer": "Yes, I can. Starting in the 1950s, early epidemiological reports were coming out and around 1950, that showed an association. In addition to that, there were some animal studies that were done showing that painting cigarette smoke condensate on the backs of mice could produce tumors. So there was a lot of conversation around and public debate around whether or not cigarette smoking and that association was enough to say that it was a cause of disease. And that was debated all through the 1950s in the public health community. At that time Reynolds did not believe that their products were injurious to health, as United Reporting, Inc. CO N J en 18d485d5~a59o4W5-94c3-2446fcd48da0 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/rspw0221 they stated in public. Come- into 1964 time frame, the Surgeon General had a committee that did research on the whole tobacco and health debate area and concluded, based on their report, that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer, at least in men at that time. The basis by which that conclusion was rendered was was mainly based on -- on the epidemiology. And Reynolds at that time would have felt and did feel that epidemiology was not traditionally what one would base a cause and effect relationship on, that prior to what the Surgeon General had said, prior to that, in order to prove cause and effect, one had to have a number of clinical lines of evidence, experimental lines of evidence that were consistent such as having a mechanism by which that disease would progress in a human being, have animal models that were that were developed and reliable that one could use for testing on those hypothesis, as well as having a good understanding about what the causative agents might be in this case in cigarettes that would that would cause that disease. Those lines of evidence were were lacking in '64. So the Reynolds would not have agreed. They United Reporting, Inc. en CO Bd485d5-a59c-4bf5~94c3-2446fcd48da0 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/rspw0221 would they would have recognized that the association was there and the statistics were sufficient enough proof to -- to say cause and effect. And that position was maintained roughly into the 1980s when Reynolds began using risk factor analysis. So epidemiology became a much more popular tool. Statistics the power the statistics were much more -- a tool that was used much more in the medical community. And so those terminology that terminology was adopted in the 1980s. And then certainly in the 1990s it was a major risk factor, that would have been Reynold's position. And finally in 2000f because of the complexities and the issues as to why Reynolds wouldn't say cause and effect because of the -- the science and the complexity of trying to explain that, I think Reynolds' position was misunderstood. And they basically altered their position in 2000 and said it's basically a cause of lung cancer."
