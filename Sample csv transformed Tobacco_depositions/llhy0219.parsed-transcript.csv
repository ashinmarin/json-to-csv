"This is Eric Snapp. I have some questions. Mr. Simmons, you talked about retail spending on cigarettes during Mr. Gdanski's questioning. When a consumer purchases cigarettes at retail, where does -- what makes up the price that that consumer pays at retail?","There are several things that make up the price at retail. The price at retail that a consumer pays includes the margins for the retailer, the margins for the wholesaler, it includes state excise taxes. It includes federal excise taxes. It includes master settlement expenses. It includes employee costs. It includes the leaf and materials to package the product, it includes employee costs, marketing selling, research costs. So there are a lot of expenses, a lot of costs included in the final price that the consumer pays."
You mentioned retail and wholesaler margins. What do those mean? What do those terms mean?,Retailer and wholesaler margins refer to the markup or the profit that a retailer and a wholesaler charge for the products that they sell.
You also mentioned I believe you mentioned settlement payments. What are settlement payments? What are the settlement payments that you're referring to?,Settlement payments
So they won't stop after 25 years; is that correct?,That is correct.
"Do you know how much Philip Morris USA has paid in settlement payments to the states, including Florida, since these settlement payments began or were entered into?","I don't have an exact number, but I think it's in excess of $20 billion."
Have you seen reports from Philip Morris USA indicating that number is actually over $60 billion?,
You can answer.,"Probably seeing reports, I know it was over 20 billion, but I didn't have the exact number at the time."
"Mr. Simmons, during the first day of this deposition you gave some testimony about the CPA exam. And I believe you testified that you had not passed that exam in its entirety. Can you explain what you meant by that? Page 60 I",Yes.
"Mr. Simmons, let me ask the question again. Did you pass the substantive portions of the CPA exam, all four parts?","Yes, I did. And after completing those four parts I made a personal decision to stop, because it was no longer required for my career, and that was a personal choice. So I did pass the substantive parts. But to obtain your license there is an ethics exam, and I elected not to take the ethics exam and then obtain a license. I was no longer in public accounting. And so I was not a practicing CPA, if you will. So it was a personal choice."
"Mr. Simmons, you were asked about dividends paid by Philip Morris USA to its parent company, Altria Group, Inc. Does Altria Group, Inc. have shareholders of its own?","Yes, they do."
"Could you describe the types or category of shareholders who own stock in Altria Group, Inc.?","There are a variety of shareholders that have that own stock in Altria, including pension plans, 401 (k)s, government retirement funds, institutions, individuals. There's a variety of shareholders."
"When shareholders purchase shares in a corporation, do they expect a return on their investment?","Yes, they do."
Is a dividend one of the ways that a company returns value to its shareholders?,"Yes, it is."
Are there other ways that a corporation returns value to its shareholders besides dividends?,Yes.
What would those ways be?,"Returning value to the shareholder could be in the form of increased depreciation in the stock price for that share within that corporation. The corporation may elect to purchase shares of its own stock, more commonly referred to as treasury stock, which can increase the earnings per share to the individual shareholder or institution that owns the shares."
"If Philip Morris USA did not pay dividends to its sole shareholder, Altria Group, Inc. would Altria Group, Inc. have less money available to pay dividends in turn to its shareholders?",Absolutely. Yes.
"You mentioned that Altria Group's shareholders include individual investors, pension plans, IRAs, and other types of investors; is that correct?",That is correct.
"With respect to the numbers reported by Mr. Padron in his report, I believe Mr. Gdanski asked you if you disagreed with the analysis done by Mr. Padron. Based on your review of his report, did Mr. Padron do any analysis of Philip Morris USA's financial condition beyond taking numbers from the SEC filings and putting them in the table on page 5 of his report?","There was not a specific analysis. The numbers appear to be a direct directly taken from the annual lOKs of Altria Group, Inc. for Philip Morris USA data. And those numbers, to the best of my knowledge, were prepared in accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles."
"Sir, I have a few questions for you. Then we'll wrap this up. Counsel for Philip Morris asked you about some of the elements that go into the cost at retail. And you mentioned margins for retail, wholesale, margins for excise tax, margins for federal excise tax, employee cost; do you remember that?",I didn't mention margins for federal and state excise taxes.
No.,"The margins were for the retailers and the wholesalers, and that represents their profit or their markup on the products that they purchase."
"Right. I'm sorry. I misspoke. Yes. Yeah, I didn't mean to say that. Let me just ask my question again, because I don't think we're disagreeing. When counsel for Philip Morris asked you about the elements that go into making up the cost of Philip Morris cigarettes at retail, you mentioned margins, which is the same as profit for retailers. You mentioned margins, which is the same as profit for wholesalers. You mentioned excise tax, employee costs and federal excise tax. Do you remember that?",Yes.
"Okay. You left out margins or profit for the manufacturer, right?","Yes. And when I gave that response, I didn't give every single cost and/or margin that goes into the retail price of a pack of cigarettes. So I was giving you examples of those things that made up the as we talked about earlier the average price of a pack not inclu different of cigarettes. Right. One of the elements that you did de in your analysis or your list of the valuations that make up the price of cigarettes sold to people in this country is the profit or true, isn the margin for the manufacturer. And it's 't it, that there is a profit margin for the manufacturer, for Philip Morris, right? Yes. Philip Morris sets the price for their cigarettes taking into account what they believe a consumer maximize their cig will spend in such a way as for them to their profit margin, correct? Could you restate your question, please? Sure. Philip Morris sets the price of arettes in such a way as to determine what they believe reasonable consumers will spend on the product, Morris's payment s, and at the same time maximize their Philip profit margin, true? Generally speaking, yes. Okay. And you talked about settlement and I object to that entire discussion, but I'm going to ask you questions about it without waiving that. You said that they've paid out you know, you said something more than $20 billion and counsel reminded you that it might be upwards of $60 billion; do you remember that?"
"The reality is that they've paid that money because they owe that money, right?","That agreement was a settlement, to the best of my knowledge, reached between the state attorney generals and the manufacturers."
"Right. And it was a settlement reached because the state attorney generals leveled an accusation against the companies, which in sum and substance was that: Hey, we, the states, have individually been paying for medical expenses, up to 19 hundreds of billions of dollars over the past years, for diseases that your product caused, right? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Object to the form.","Again, this was a settlement that was reached between the two parties for which the manufacturers have an obligation that will go on into perpetuity. It's not 25 years. But they're making payments, and will continue to make them into perpetuity based on the agreement that was reached between the two parties."
"Sure. And you already said that. Now I'm asking you how we got there. You're talking about what's going on going forward, how much they have to pay on a yearly basis and how much they will have to pay. I'm asking you why are they paying it? It's not goodwill. It's not charity, right? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Object to form.","I wasn't part of the settlement; but as I mentioned earlier, that was an agreement that was reached between the two parties in an effort to settle Medicaid claims that were coming before the states. And the two parties agreed that in order to settle, there would be this agreement, and then the manufacturers would make these payments, along with other restrictions, that would go on into perpetuity."
"Right. And so, what happened was you agree, and you're familiar what happened was that in the mid 1990s, several states some states in unison sued the tobacco companies to recoup to recover Medicaid costs, right? hey, we h Page 68 I Yes. Okay. And so, what those states said is, ave a Medicaid program or we're subsidizing -- state funds are subsidizing medical expenses of state residents, right? Okay. That's true, right? Yes. Okay. And the states said: And now we've come to learn, tobacco companies, that we've been spen billions ding billions of dollars hundreds of of dollars -- of state Medicaid funds to pay for medical expenses for completely avoidable diseases that your money. process, right ? product has caused. So you guys owe us That was the allegation, right? Okay. Okay. And then after a litigation the states and the tobacco companies settled, Yes. Okay. So these expenditures, these settlement payments that you're trying to take credit for, they are the result of states making accusations and allegations that the tobacco companies owed hundreds of millions,, if not billions well, strike that hundreds of billions of dollars in what never should have been spent by the state, right?","I'm not a legal expert. And I gave you my perspective on the expenses that the company incurs today, and that those expenses will go on into perpetuity. I'm not the legal expert relative to the merits of what took place going into the agreement."
"I guess just to be crystal clear, you do understand that these payments are payments made to recover monies spent by the state through the Medicaid program to treat for and care for injured smokers in those states over many years, right?","Again, I'm not the legal expert. I know that the company is compliant with the agreement; and that that compliance, especially in the form of its financial obligations, will go on into perpetuity."
"You said you ultimately passed all four components of the CPA exam, right?",That is correct.
And how many different times did it take for you to pass all four components?,I don't know the exact number.
"But the CPA exam is an exam that's taken -- it's one test that has four different stages to it, right?",That is correct.
"And in order to become a certified public accountant, a CPA, you need to pass all four, but you don't need to pass them all four at the same time in a given calendar year, right?","That is correct. Let me just add one more piece to what you were saying. There's the four substantive parts; and then to become certified you take an ethics exam, which is a true/false test. And then you qualify for obtaining your license. I made a personal decision to stop after"
We'll get to that.,"-- the technical parts, and did not go on with the remaining part."
"Right. Got it. Okay. So after you pass the first component of the exam, you still need to pass the next three. And after you pass the first and second, you need to pass the third and fourth. After you pass the first, second, and third, you need to pass the fourth, right?",That is correct.
Okay. And do you need to retake the first part of the exam after you pass it the first time?,"No, you do not. I think if there's"
How many times,"if there's and again, this is going back many years now. But I think if a certain time period elapses, you may need to go back and take parts that you may have passed over again."
How many times did you have to take the first part of the exam?,I don't recall. I just know that I passed all four parts.
Did you have to take the first part can you take the second part before you pass the first part?,"It's changed over the years; but at the time when I took it, you sat for all four parts in one setting. And as you passed parts, you then sat for the remaining parts that you did not pass."
"So when you took it the first time you took it, in order to even begin to take the second part of the exam, you had to first pass the first part; is that right?","No. There were four parts to the exam and. When you sat, you sat for all four parts in one sitting."
"Okay. Then you got back your scores and they said, hey, you passed sections one and three, and you didn't pass you failed sections two and four, let's say, right?",Correct.
"And then the next time you took it the next year, did you have to just take sections two and four?",
Do you remember my last question?,"No. Could you please restate it, please?"
"After you let's say during that first test you passed sections one and three, and you failed sections two and four. The next time you took the Page 73 l test, did you have to take sections one and three again or no? No. Okay. So how many times did you take section one of the CPA exam? That was pass all recall. personal I don't recall. I passed all four parts. the personal goal. I passed all four parts. How many times did it take for you to four? Again, that was a long time ago. I don't But I passed all four parts and achieved the goal and then I stopped. So ultimately speaking, after repeated efforts of failing the CPA exam, you did ultimately pass all correct ? four separate sections of the CPA exam, I passed all four parts of the exam. I don't recall how many times I took it. Once I passed all four parts, I achieved my personal goal. I was no longer in public accounting. And if I stayed in public accounting, I would have continued with the certification because it would have been a requirement. It was no longer required, and I achieved my personal goal.",
"Well, let's just be clear. The last time you took the exam, the time that you finally passed the last remaining section, you were no longer in the field of public accounting, correct? You hadn't been working for Philip Morris, and you were not going to be, and knew already you were not going to become a public accountant, right?",That is correct.
"And you ultimately passed the CPA exam, and there was one last step remaining in order for you to become what's known as a certified public accountant, right?",That is correct.
"And that last one step that was remaining while you were an employee of Philip Morris USA in order to become a certified public accountant was a true or false ethics exam, right?",That is correct.
