I don't know if they put a number on it. | Was it statistically significant? I would say it was, yeah. And, certainly, the epidemiological reports between non filters and filters, at the time they came out in the 50's, 60's and 70's, certainly indicated that. Do you know what percentage of the population was smoking a filtered cigarette in 1960? In 1960, it would have been less. There were -- Filters had became popular after Winston came out in 1954. So by 1960, I wouldn't -- I don't think it was s half at that point, but certainly as you move through the 60's, it certainly rapidly increased. And, you know, where we are today, obviously, there's very few people that smoke non filtered cigarettes and almost everybody is smoking not only filtered cigarettes, but lower yielding cigarettes. Were the filters added to cigarettes for safety reasons?",

I think the surgeon general and others may have suggested that cigarette design plays a role. But, like I said, the latest paper I've read, that the adenocarcinoma rates have not only increased for cigarette smokers but it's also increased for non smokers. So, if the adeno rates in non smokers is increasing in a similar way to cigarette smokers, then one can't attribute that to cigarette design, or at least they can't fully attribute that to cigarette design.

Q A Q A haven't done We haven't completed -- We didn't have to complete any kind of clinical studies with people prior to having to release the product to market. We studied the aerosol, we studied the ingredients, we studied the battery, we studied how it was generating an aerosol. It was stewarded through our stewardship program that did not require any kind of animal testing or those types of tests. Did you do any evaluation of the potential harmful effects that VUSE might have? That's what product stewardship is, so we stewarded the product. We made a determination of what was chemically in the aerosol, what was in the liquid, what the component parts were, of how we were going to construct the cartridge, the wick, the computer chips that are in both the cartridge and the battery. So the whole device was stewarded from both the materials perspective as well as what would be delivered to the consumer. So do you know what the harmful effects of VUSE would be? We don't know what the harmful --We don't know that there's going to be any harmful effects from VUSE. They're -- what we know is that the aerosol comprises of glycerin, PG, and a little bit of nicotine and 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING some flavor compounds.

A number of public health groups have suggested that cigarettes. In fact,: the UK says they're going to be 95 percent safer.

We have certainly, from a regulatory perspective, attempted to do that, preparing for potential product standards.

Or when we use certain other techniques, like microwave techniques or supercritical fluid extractions, you endup, like I said, pulling out not just nicotine but a lot of other flavorful components end up coming along for the ride when you do those extractions, so you're left with a very bland, unflavorful (sic) tobacco at the end of the day, which is not terribly consumer friendly, at least from the stuff we've made with it. xs reconsrxrureo. rooacco \" xn reconsrxruroo. rooacco, is the nicotine taken out of it? it is *\"\"~ wexx, IT xs GxrracreQ wxrn warer unci rne nicotine comes out in the water extract -- most of it.

Well, again, I think I already talked about the craving relief studies, I think that's .obviously not the case. I think, certainly, nicotine is expected by smokers, so in some cases, there may be smokers that certainly want nicotine. If your premise was absolutely correct, that all smokers ever wanted was nicotine, then Nicorette gum should be flying off the shelf, because you could get all the nicotine you'd want from that, and more now that it's over-the-counter, but that's not the case. Well, the nicotine gum does not go into the body the same way as the cigarettes, nicotine from cigarettes, V* trJ *- V#* V* L* tt But, it does go into the body and it does go to the brain and you can measure nicotine in the blood stream.

Well, in most cases, or many cases, those technologies were evaluated favorably through the NCI, TWG, specifically through the massive animal testing that was done. They did an awful lot of mouse skin painting testing, which was really the best technique they had available at the time. All were very positive, especially for reconstituted tobacco, expanded, filter dilution as well. They did massive chemistry studies, tried to understand the effects of tar in nicotine yields, through the implementation of those technologies, again favorable in terms of yield reduction in most cases.

You talked about techniques that were implemented. Did Reynolds research on. trying to make safer products stop in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, or did it continue after that time? Oh, no, it continued. It's still going on today inside of Reynolds' R&D laboratories? It is still today. If Reynolds wanted today to make a change to one of its cigarettes because it thought it had a potential to make smoking less risky or it wanted to make a change for any reason whatsoever, could it do that on its own? No. Why not? Because we're regulated by the FDA. And does the FDA allow Reynolds or any other cigarette manufacturers to make any change to its products without receiving FDA approval? 3RD AVENUE NORTH -BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING 9. 7V Page 235 j You cannot make changes.

If they had a concern about an additive that the companies were using, they were to notify congress and get that additive removed. That was the authority they had with obtaining the list. In the I guess almost 30 years that Reynolds and the other manufacturers have been providing their additive information to DHHS, to your knowledge, have they ever notified congress that they had a concern about one of the additives? Not to this point. FDA Does FDA have oversight over the additives that Reynolds uses? Certainly, they do. Okay.

How does VUSE compare?",
                        "answer": "Well, VUSE is quite different in that -- and, look, there's not anything necessarily wrong with this, but most of those devices are made in China and the quality control can, at times, be suspect. Then, of course, there's some very fine products that come out of China at the same time. But, for Reynolds, what we felt was important was we felt it was very important for us to have control over the cartridge manufacture for VUSE and the e-liquid manufacturing, and control over that production. So we automated a means by which we could make those cartridges. Now what -- the cartridges in China -- and we've been over there a bunch -- are made by hand, literally by groups of individuals, men and women, sitting at long tables -assembling these cartridges by hand, so we felt that that' was a quality control issue. Certainly, it's fine to have a hand crafted chair, it's quite another thing to have a hand crafted assembled part, and it's never the quality control is never as good as you can get when you can automate and have machines do it. So we automated and invented automated equipment to make our cartridges. We have a proprietary and unique system by which the cartridge connects to a battery, so you 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397 Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hkhl0223 FREEDOM COURT REPORTING can only use a VUSE cartridge with a VUSE battery. We implemented battery safety controls, over-charge protection, so that the battery, lithium-ion battery, so that it doesn't explode on charging, which I'm sure people have seen that happen with lithium-ion batteries. In fact, I was watching the TV the other night. Those hoverboards that everybody wants for Christmas, they seem to be blowing up all the time. That's a lithium-ion battery malfunction. So if you don't have the proper battery control systems in place from the charging mechanism perspective, they can catch fire. So, we've instituted those types of control. So a whole variety of those type of quality controls we've put in place in the manufacture of VUSE as well as parts testing and stewardship of the product. So -- I'm sorry.

It's difficult to -- It would be very difficult to tamper with and, as I said, the cartridge itself, once the time runs out on that cartridge, it shuts off, it can't be shut back on. So even if somebody wanted to, say, use a syringe and jam some liquid msiQc a vubJii carrriQge, ii it was an expiree cartridge, you could put the liquid in there but you couldn't use it, because the VUSE battery recognizes that cartridge is dead. You've got two --you've got a battery chip and you've got a cartridge chip and they talk to one another and it helps control that system, so it's pretty clever in that sense. Are you aware of any other e-cigarettes manufactured that has that kind of technology that VUSE has? Not that I'm aware of, no. One other issue on how VUSE may be different from another -- you mentioned in response to Mr. Gale's question about people cranking the voltage up on some of these e-cigarettes.

That safeguard and the other safeguard you talked about, including product stewardship and making sure you're using quality ingredients and stuff, are there any existing today current regulations that require Reynolds to adopt or pursue all of those safeguards? None at all. In fact, the FDA has considered e-cigarettes to be a deemed product, but have yet to issue their guidance or their regulations yet. So right now, it's in essence an unregulated product.

I mean, I think it has a very high potential of doing that. I mean, looking at the aerosol chemistry, very difficult to find anything in there, and it's hard to -- you know, when the levels get so low that you have to change all your methodology to try to get down even further to try to find stuff, you know you're -- I think you know you're heading in the right direction.

Although it's not definitively proven, we do know that it produces lower exposures of carcinogens and toxicants to smokers who use them, so it's probably lower in risk. Certainly, it's well known, at least well known to the public health community, that all smokeless tobacco products are significantly lower in risk than smoking cigarettes, even though tobacco consumers don't necessarily know that, but they are significantly lower in risk.

But it's hundreds of millions of dollars will be required to run the regulatory agency for tobacco out to infinity.

On the Quest side, the GMO tobaccos, if you change the genetic make up of the tobacco, you're likely going to shift all those ratios of amino acids and alkaloids so you probably have a bit of a different taste in those products as well.
