"Good morning, Dr. Figlar. My name is Gary Paige. You and I have met a couple times in the past. I'm sure you understand the rules of a deposition, but I'm going to be asking you some qiiestions, and if you don't understand my question or you don't know the answer, just feel free to let me know, okay?","I will try. Qt And if you need any breaks, you let us VBRITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com know as well, okay?"
"And this is not the first time that you've given a deposition in a tobacco oase, is it?","No, sir, it is not."
And how many depositions have you given in the past?,"I have not counted recently, but I would say it'8 certainly over 65 depositions."
"Okay. And most of them have been in the past three or four years, correct?","Since about '09 I would say, something like that."
Okay. And my understanding is before you gave any deposition at all in any case you spent about a year reviewing documents and meeting with lawyers; is that correct?,Approximately.
And so now you've been designated as this ocise in this oase as the corporate representative with most knowledge of certain subject matters; is that correct?,
Have you reviewed the deposition notice in this oase?,"I have, yes."
And do you have an understanding of the scope of this deposition?,I do.
"And do you understand that you are listed as the R. J. Reynolds corporate representative with the knowledge of the relationship and participation with TIRC, CTR, TI and the actual roles and purpose served by each suoh entity?",
"And you are familiar with the TIRC, I take it?",I am.
"And you're familiar with who the CTR and the TI are as well, correct?","Yes, I am."
So what i s your understanding of your r o l e in t h i s depos i t ion then?,"My understanding of my r o l e in t h i s depos i t i on i s I am the person with the most knowledge with regard to those organisa t ions and the r e l a t i o n s h i p Reynolds had with them over tho VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 GO si O CD CX> s j http://www.veritext.com years, and I have -- obviously in the Duvall County deposition I spent a great deal of time reviewing a lot of those documents, and I've reviewed many of the documents that you sent with regard to this subject. So I think I'm reasonably well prepared to take the deposition."
Okay. And you've been designated from R. J. Reynolds as the person from that company with the most knowledge on these topics?,That is correct.
"And you and in advance of your dieposition we actually sent you the exhibits that W0 intend to go over with you for you to review, correct?","Yes, you have."
"And you have done that, right?",I have.
And then yesterday your lawyer sent me additional documents that you've reviewed in preparation for this deposition. Did ~- did you bring with you everything that you reviewed to prepare for this deposition?,"I believe I have it all here, yes."
Okay. And tell me what you brought with you. VBR1TEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c,"Well, we brought the"
"So I want to talk to you then I want to just get into the subject matter we're here for today, okay, Dr. Figlar? and",Okay.
Okay. So you --.I want to go back to are you aware of the Wynder and Graham findings linking oigarette smoke into lung oanoer? t)ie,"Well, I under -- I know the data. I know article where they talked about both the VBRITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 sj o http://www.veritext.com ""H * W I M I I I r c i epidemiology or the early parts of the epidemiology that came out at that time frame, yes."
Okay. So what is your understanding about the article that was published by Wynder and Graham in 1953? What -- what was that article and what was the significance of it?,"Well, if it's the article I'm thinking of, which I'm thinking it is the epidemiology as opposed to the other -- some other scientific articles, then they would have suggested that there may be an association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking or they first made that proposition in the early '50s. 0^ Okay. And did that article and those findings receive a lot of publioity in 1953?"
"Okay. What * what ~~ Doctor, I want to talk about some outstanding articles studies of those articles, but what you tell me what you're talking about.","I thought you ~- well, I mean, if you want to show me a particular document, I'd bo happy to VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Oi o CD cn http://www.veritext.com r c r i look at it, but I -- I thought you were talking about Wynder and Graham's discussion of epidemiology. I know there was a -- I think it was a Hill article in 1950 from Britain, Doll and Hill, I think, if my memory serves me right. That was another epidemiology discussion. If you're talking about mouse skin painting, I'm aware of that as well."
Okay. So you are aware of the mouse skin painting study and article that came out in from Wynder and Graham?,"Uh-huh, yes."
Okay. And are you aware that that article linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer?,"I'm aware that they suggested that in general terms because they believed that they painted cigarette tars on the backs of mice and produced -- were able to produce skin tumors, so tfiat was a suggestion."
Okay. And did that article receive a lot of publicity back in 1953?,"Sure, that one did as well. Uh-huh."
"And following that -- that -- the publicity of that article in 1953, was -- do you know when in relationship to that article was VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol sj o CD Ol ro http://www.veritext.com lyUrWt* . Ei >.i> W M W W H H M i t t . .IMMIIII M * M * W * c c when was the TIRC formed?","I think the TIRC was formed in 1954, so probably a year or so after that article."
And are you aware of the ~~ the Frank Statement to cigarette smokers?,"Yes, I am. (Figlar Exhibit 1, Dooument titled Preliminary Recommendations for Cigarette Manufacturers dated 12/24/53, PT02166, was marked for identification.)"
"Do you have in front of you Exhibit 2166, Doctor, Exhibit 1?",I do.
Okay. And is this one of the documents that you were provided and that you reviewed prior VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.vcrhcxt.com 212-490-3430 Ol GO v| O CD Ol http://www.vcrhcxt.com to your deposition?,I did. And what is this document?
"Okay. And it's dated December 24th, 1953, cjorreot?","It is, yes."
And if you could go to the last page of that document and read into the record who was pjresent at this meeting.,Do you want me to read the titles as well?
"Well, if you could read the last page of the document and tell the jury who was present at the meeting, please?","It says Paul M. Hahn, president, American Tobacco; Joseph F. Cullman, Jr., chairman and president of Benson & Hedges; 0. Parker McComas, President, Philip Morris & Company; J. Whitney Peterson, President, U.S. Tobacco Company; and then there's dots and it says, P. Lorillard Company."
Okay. And do you understand this - - i n this document whether they're discussing the mjaeting -- they're discussing that tho -- they're VBR1TBXT REPORTING COMPANY 212- 79-9424 www.veritexl.com 212-4 90-3430 http://www.veritexl.com discussing the mouse painting study and the publicity that it received? Are you aware of that?,"If my memory serves me, I think they're talking about that and general issues facing the industry with regard to potential associations between cigarette smoking and disease."
"Okay. And can you read the second paragraph of this document into the record for the jury, please.","Certainly. On Page 1? Q, Yes."
"And when they're talking about the whole matter, do you know what matter they're referring to?","Well, I believe they're talking about smoking and health concerns, which they point out in the earlier paragraph in those reports."
"And could you turn to the next --if you cbuld turn to the next page, please, and read VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212*2^9-9424 www.verllext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.verllext.com mm "" i "" i ...** J^**S, C the -- the -- the second paragraph that starts out the situation is one. Can you publish that into the record for the jury, please?","It reads, the situation is one of extreme delicacy. There is much at stake and the industry group, in moving into the field of public relations, needs to exercise great care not to add fuel to the flames."
"Now, again, when they're talking about the situation being one of extreme delicacy, do you khow what situation they're referring to?","Well, I mean, I believe it would be they're talking about the articles that are coming out and the potential links between cigarette smoking and ** and health outcomes"
"Now, if you can go down two more paragraphs to the one, two, three, four ~- fifth paragraph and sixth paragraph which starts with the underlying purpose. In this document, do they discuss the purpose of Hill & Knowlton and the TIRC?","I don't know about TIRC particular, but I believe the purpose of public relations, as I pointed out in the last one, I think they would discuss what that would be. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.verilext.com 212490-3430 CM o c Ol http://www.verilext.com"
"Okay. Can you read into the ~- into the record those two paragraphs that start with the underlying purpose, please.","Sure. The underlying purpose of any activity at this stage should be reassurance of the public through wider communication of facts to the public It is important that the public recognise the existence of weighty scientific views which hblds there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer. In connection with this ~- with the proposed activity, it is impossible to overlook the fact that some of the industry's advertising has come in for serious public oritioism because of emphasis on health aspects of smoking."
"And when they're talking about advertising and the effects of advertising, do you know what they were referring to -- what type of advertisement they were referring to?",Not necessarily. I'm not an
Well,"-- advertising guy. Q, Well, do you know that R. J. Reynolds was using doctors to promote smoking baok at this time period, the '40s and '50s? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com"
"Okay. So when the when they're talking about the the okay. So the -- the the next part of this document, if you can go to the third page, they're talking about the following recommendations are submitted for consideration by the manufacturers; do you see that?",I do.
"And the Number 2 it says, they want to fbrm a committee called the Tobacco Research Committee; do you see that?",I do.
"And did they actually do that? Did they do that, form a committee called the Tobaooo Research Committee?","I I believe in general they did, yes."
"Okay. And on the next page, on Number 4, it talks about a public statement by cigarette makers; do you see that?",I do.
And so what is the recommendation of P. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com public statement that was wanting to be made at that time?,Do you want me to read it?
"Yes, sir, if you could.","Okay. It says, the statement should be, (a), distributed wide do you want me to read from the beginning of four or do you want me to rfead from the bullet points? I'm sorry, Counselor"
"Well, it says the the public -- the first public statement should be designed, if you could read that paragraph.","Okay. It says the the first public statement of the committee should be designed to clarify the problem and to reassure the public that, (a), the industry's first and foremost interest is the public health; (b) there is no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung cancer; and (c) the industry is inaugurating a joint plan to deal with the situation. It goes on to say, this statement should be: (a), distributed widely as news, and to employees, stockholders, distributors, tobaooo growers, dealers, suppliers, public officials, national and committee leaders and other groups; (b) placed as an advertisement in leading VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com a c c c newspapers and in leading news magazines."
"Do you think, as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, do you agree that it was well, do you agree that it was important that the interests of public health be first and foremost? A, I mean, I agree that that's what's said here. 1 think it is important, so yeah, I mean, in general I agree.",
"And that was something that they were going to reassure the public that they would do that, right?",
". And then they also wanted to reassure the public that there was no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung cancer, correct?","They -- they they did want that message to get out, yes, that's correct."
"And they wanted people to believe that, right?",
And why would they want the message out there to reassure the public that there was no pjroof?,"Because they didn't believe that the that the science supported a direct link between smoking and disease, and especially in the 1950s there was a lot of question about whether or not that link could be established. So ~-"
And they wanted --,-- they certainly -- they didn't want people to draw that conclusion before -- before it could be looked at more thoroughly.
"Exactly. They didn't want the public to conclude that and they didn't want the public to believe that, right?",
"So if smokers in 1950s did not yet believe VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com that smoking caused lung cancer, that would have been appropriate based upon what you know as the corporate representative of R. J. Reynolds, correct?",
"Okay. And then the next exhibit, Exhibit 2, if you could look at that, please.",Where do I put this? 307?
"Yes, so you have Exhibit 2. Tell the jury what that is, please.",This is A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers. This is tho statement that the joint VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c r i industry sponsors put out publicly.
"And that was ~~ it received a lot of publicity, correct?",I don't know how much publicity it was rboeived. I know it went into a lot of newspapers.
Do you know how many newspapers?,"The exact number, I don't. I think somewhere around 400."
400 newspapers?,"I don't know exactly, but I think if my memory serves, I think the suggestion was it should go out in 400 papers."
And do you know if it was a full page ad in in each newspaper?,I don't.
Do you know if it received publicity on TV as well?,"TV, I don't know if it did or not."
"Okay. And so if you could read the Frank Statement -- the Number 3 to the jury, please.","Which Number 3? Q, On the left-hand column."
And then if you could read the last two VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 m o <D o> http://www.veritext.com paragraphs on the left-hand column.,"It says, we believe the products we make are not injurious to health. We also have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task is to safeguard the public health."
"And -- and, I'm sorry, the - - o n Number 2, if you could read that paragraph on the right-hand cblumn.","Okay. It says, Number 2, for this purpose we are establishing a joint industry group consisting initially of the undersigned. This group will be known as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee."
"So that was when the publio was first advised that the TIRC was being formed, correct?","They were advised, yes."
"And it was at the same time that the public was being informed that there was no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, correct?","Well, they were certainly informed of the industry's position on that matter. They were bfeing informed otherwise from other authorities. 0- But that was the first -- that was at th sjame time that the publio was advised by the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY wwwveritext.com 212-490-3430 Oi w http://wwwveritext.com ^twm * *M.III i i r r tobaooo industry that there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, correct?"
And in the Frank Statement the cigarette industry told the publio that we accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility paramount to every other consideration in our business; do you see that? Did I read that correctly?,"You did, yes."
So you would agree that that would mean to th public that they would they were putting people's health paramount and more important than profits?,
Including making money? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Oi o a> Ol http://www.veritext.com wm(hMwl4M*aMt* c c c,It would.
"So at that point, any smoker who was reading this could be assured that there was no -- at least conceivably be assured by the cigarette companies that there was no proof that smoking caused lung cancer, that their health was more important to the cigarette manufacturer than making money would be, and that they were going to form this TIRC, correct?",
What is the Tobacco Institute?,"The Tobacco Institute is an industry advocacy group that was basically split off from this original TIRC in, I think, 1958 or thereabouts."
"And was the - - s o tho TIRC was supposed to VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 JHWMaJWWW* IMIII tn (D O) http://www.veritext.com MHfrMNttpUMNftNMMMMMtftM r c c be doing research, correct?","I think the TIRC as originally formulated was both to not necessarily do research, but to certainly fund research as --"
Okay.,"they stated in the in the in the Frank Statement, but also act as the public voice for the industry at that time. They later broke out the Tobaooo Institute as the advocacy or voice of the industry as I said in 1958 and then kept the CTR as a grant and aid group to continue to do the scientific research,"
Okay. And who funded the CTR and the mhrufO 4. jJLIVV* I,"The assigned assigned members below, if you want me to read them all, but the tobaooo companies, leaf growers and other people involved in the industry."
"Okay, So the TIRC and the CTR were funded by the industry, correct?","That is my understanding, yes."
And the Tobacco Institute was also funded b ^ the industry?,That is my understanding.
"Now, once the Tobaooo Institute was VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol http://www.veritext.com W M M I I M P M M M M W M X I c c r funded was was formed, were they making statements to the public about the health hazards of smoking?","I think after the TIRC was formed in the 1950s there were there were some statements made. There were obviously news programs. It was a news item. And so the TIRC was contacted and I think mostly the chairman, I think it was Dr. Little, made a number of statements, but I believe others did as well."
"Okay. And the Tobacco Institute, as well, they would also make public statements, oorreot? A, Again, once the Tobaooo Institute was formed and broken off from the TIRC they would, yds. Q, And the purpose of these public statements was to inform the public, oorreot?","Sure. Yes. Q, And you wanted people to believe them, rjlght?"
"You wanted people to be able to read -- r^ad the position of the tobacco industry, take it seriously and oonsider it to be credible information, right?","I would say in general, yeah, that would H true. The Tobacco Institute spoke for the industry. The industry had its views that were bjtsed in the way they viewed the scienoe, and so, y^ah, they would want those views considered by those who heard them as one of the sets of information that people would get to be informed on VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com issues."
"You wanted people to be informed on accurate, honest information, correct, not lies?","Correot. (Figlar Exhibit 3, Newspaper article titled Richards Calls 'Digest' Cigaret Article 'Unfair' dated 6/30/58, PT04900, was marked for identification.)"
And do you know who Richard Mr. Richards is?,"I well, it says right here on the front. It says the president of Tobaooo Institute."
"Okay. And when you were reading this document in preparation of your deposition, did you familiarize yourself with who Mr. James P. Richards was?","No, not necessarily."
"Okay. But as a person today sitting hero VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.vcritext.com 212-490-3430 CD o http://www.vcritext.com with the most knowledge from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, do you have an understanding that Mr. James P. Richards was the president of the Tobacco Institute in 1958?","I have no reason to dispute it, it's written right here in the article."
"Okay. And you can go to the second paragraph and read the quote from Mr. Richards into the record, please.",Sure. Starting with the implications?
"The second paragraph, sir.","Okay. It says, the cigarette industry has not ohangod its nind. Our position was and is based on the fact that scientific evidence does not support the theory that there is anything in cigarette smoke known to cause human lung cancer."
"And, again, that's something that you wanted the public to be able to read and believe, correct?",' res.
"And if you could read the next -- the next two paragraphs, please.","It says ""the implications of this piece,"" Mr. Richards said, ""are most unfair to the tobacco industry and to the general public."" ""The Tobacco VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Institute"
"And I'm sorry, I don't I don't mean to interrupt you. The piece that he's talking about, he's responding to an artiole that says smoking does cause lung cancer, correct?",They're talking about a - I believe it says a Digest -* the a Digest artiole?
A Reader's Digest?,"I don't know -- it doesn't say Reader's Digest, but it says Digest. Oh, it is Reader's Digest. I'm sorry. It says the Cigarette Industry Changes Its Mind was the name of the article. So they're talking about a Reader's Digest artiole."
"Right. What Mr. Richards is saying in that next paragraph is the implications of the pieoe, the article, are most unfair to the tobacco industry and to the general publio, oorreot?",Correct.
"So being fair to the general public is important; you would agree with that, correct?","It would, yes."
"Being fa ir and honest would be important, not only for Reader's Digest, but also for the tobacco industry, correct? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212*279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",Certainly.
And if you could read the next paragraph.,"It says ""the Tobaooo Institute, Mr. Richards continued, ""believes that the health o\t people is more important than dividends for any i industry. We are equally convinced that the American people believe in fair play for an industry that historically began and grew with the life of our country, all the while providing work f|or, and contributing to the contentment of, millions."""
"And then trust and fair play should also be important for your consumers as well, correct?",Certainly.
"And where it says the -- the industry the Tobacco Institute believes the health of the pjeople is more important than dividends, that would ba important not only in 1958, but also 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, that the publio health be more important than dividends; would you agree with t^at?","I would, yes,"
And if the tobaooo industry put dividends or profits over public health you would agree that would be wrong? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritcxt.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritcxt.com,"I "" I ***** I think in a general sense I wbuld, yes."
"And so people reading this artiole, it wbuld be reasonable for them to believe that the tobaooo industry was being fair and forthright with them as well, correct?",
"And so we can go to the next document and that's a 19 - it's a 19 -- it's Exhibit -- what is this, Exhibit 4, oorreot?","It is, 1563."
"1563, correct, and this is a February 5th, 1958, letter from American Tobacco, correct?",
"And who is Mr. Hill, by the way?",I don't know personally. I believe it was probably the somebody at Hill & Knowlton. I dkm't know if it's the founder or not. I'm not all that familiar with Hill & Knowlton's history.
"Well, Dr. Figlar, when you wore preparing VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212479-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com i ii > IIIIHIUMM HHiWH> wHMpmi (* c f^ fbr the deposition and you and you were being -** understanding that you were going to be asked these j questions about these documents, and we gave these documents to you 30 days in advance, knowing that you were the corporate rep with the most knowledge, did you think it might be important to look into who these people were? There was only about documents that we gave you to review.",
"No, but did you like ask the lawyers, hey, b^ the way, who is John Hill or you didn't you didn't think it would be important?",
"In any event, do you know who Mr. Hahn is?",I believe he was the president of American Tobacco at the time.
"Okay. So Mr. Hahn wrote a letter to VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol o (O oo oo http://www.veritext.com c c c Mr. Hill, correct, on February 5th, 1958?","That is this document, yes."
"And part of the document Mr. Hahn is discussing is what are the major -'- what are the major area of activity and major objectives of the Tobacco Institute, correct?","I think in general that is correct, yes."
"And the Tobacco Institute, again, you you've already told us they were being portrayed to t^e public as a honest and forthright organization, cbrreot?","Yes, I can. In my opinion, the institute's major area of activity and major objective should be to defend the industry against attacks from whatsoever source on tobacco as an -- as an alleged health hazard, including efforts to impore labeling requirements on tob&ooo products VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol NI o http://www.veritext.com mVkmmmwmmmmmmWmmmmm*' i\wium*m*H****mmmummm r c c i based directly or indirectly on the charge that tobacco is a hazard to health."
"Okay. So the -- was the public ever advised in any public statement that that was the objective of the tobacco industry -- of the Tobacco institute, to defend the industry against attacks from whatsoever source on tobacco as an alleged health hazard?","Were they - are you asking me if they were informed of the objectives? I think it was -- you know, I don't know if they were informed in that way and said, these are the objectives of the Tobacco Institute, but I mean I think it's been pretty clear that the statements made by the Tobacco institute and their actions would support what this statement is, which is they put out what the companies' positions were on the science and certainly disseminated them. Q, You're saying the company's position, wouldn't it be important to put out what the -- what the belief and -- what the belief was, not just the position, but the belief of the company?"
"And that's what they wanted the publio to believe, that there was not scientific evidence to sjupport the cause and effect of smoking and lung cancer, correct?",
"And then if you could read the next paragraph, what is the Institute's position -- strike that. By the way, so Mr. Hahn is the president of American Tobacco, oorreot?","I believe that's correct, yes."
"And in his letter he's setting forth Number 2, what is the Institute's position on health charges against tobacco use, oorreot?","That is Bullet Point Number 2, yes."
And what does the president of American Tobacco indicate that the view should be? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.coni 212-490-3430 H#MVr4imllMe***iJM Ol o CD NJ http://www.veritext.coni,"He -- he says in here, broadly speaking, it is my view that the Institute's position on the health charges against tobacco should be that in the present state of scientific evidence these charges are unfounded. (This is elaborated in the answers to the later questions -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overtalk you."
"If you could go -- and if you could go to Page Number 4, please.",Certainly. Okay.
"And if you could read Number 6 as well, please.","Number 6, should the Institute have a policy regarding moderation and smoking for responding to requests on this matter? It says, in my view the polioy of the Institute regarding qjueries as to moderation and smoking should be that w* believe that smoking is not harmful to normal individuals; that overindulgence and excess in anything may be harmful; that what is overindulgence or excess varies with the particular individual, who should be guided by the advice of"
"And at that time were there any warnings oh cigarette packages at that time that smoking was 212-^79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com WIIWtHilHiii I intmWHIII'm J0""***. C j0""*^\: c harmful or smoking caused lung cancer?","Not in 1958, no. Q, And what was the industry's position on labeling at that time, if you could read Number 7."
You can read the number and the answer.,"Okay. What is the Institute's position on such specific matters as labeling contents of cigarettes, putting on warning labels, adding punitive taxes to discourage consumption? Matters such as labeling contents of cigarettes, putting on warning labels, adding punitive taxes to discourage consumption all arise out of the charges that tobacco is a health hazard. Th Institute's position on all such matters should be that it has not been proved that tobacco is a health hazard; that it that its use is a universal pleasure and relaxation; that many hundreds of thousands of people depend on it for their livelihood; and that any step in the direction of discouraging the consumption of tobacco is unjustified and harmful."

And is that -- those statements that you wanted or that the Tobaooo Institute wanted the public to believe?,
"That there was no proof that tar and nicotine has significance in terms of human health, correct?","That certainly was the belief at that time, and I think we would all agree today that nicotine is not particularly harmful."

"So this ~- so this artiole is the one that we discussed in that prior exhibit that was going tb be included in that massive mailing to doctors ahd community leaders, correct?","It was listed, yes. (Figlar Exhibit 14, Artiole from January 1968 issue of True, The Man's Magazine, PT02808, was marked for identification.)"
"And this artiole is actually Exhibit 20 -- Exhibit 14, 2808, if you can pull that up or bring that to your attention, please.","I have it, sir."
"And if you oould read the -- the part of ^ e first page on the left column, To Smoke Or Not t6 Smoke - That is Still the Question; do you see that, with still underlined?","Yes, sir."
And could you read the part underneath that?,"Are cigarettes really ""hazardous to your health"" like the package says? Nobody knows. In aijiy oase, Americans are smoking more than ever and, curiously, worrying less.

"And that's what the industry wanted, correct?",
"Well well, when the artiole came out that said nobody knows, nobody from the tobacco industry came forward and admitted that they knew that smoking caused lung oancer, did they?","No, they wouldn't have known that."
"And when the it's your testimony under o^th that they wouldn't have known that despite the documents that you've reviewed, correct, that's what you're telling us under oath, right, Doctor?","That is correct. 0- Okay. And then it says, in any oase, Americans are smoking more than ever and, curiously, worrying less; do you see that?"
"And that was in 1968, correct?","Yes. Q, And that was because of the controversy and the confusion around surrounding this issue, correct? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol oo o CD CD ro http://www.veritext.com II I ""I"" I' ."
You never heard that was the oase? You djidn't know that?,"I don't know that to be true. I mean, based on the dooument I'm sorry, but based on the documents we just read, the TI would suggest that that was not the case. So I don't -- I don't khow that that that that is that that is a -- a correct assumption or not."
"Okay. And then it goes on -- I'm going to r^ad I'm not going to read the whole artiole, but on Page 35, for example, it says it says -- if you could read the third paragraph into the record.",Starting with maybe?
Yeah.,"Maybe cigarettes cause cancer and maybe they don't. In any oase, it's clear that Americans a^e not convinced or, if they were, they were willing to take their chances. As a result, the tobacco business prospered."
And the is there any mention in that VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t 9-9424 www.verilext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.verilext.com article about a concern from the tobacco industry about the health of the smokers?,"I'm sorry, in the whole artiole or in just that paragraph?"
"Yes, Any -- any anywhere in this article you reviewed. Is there anywhere that they expressed a concern about how many of their consumers are dying from lung cancer? A, I don't think they make mention of of that, but I think they do talk about the research that's being done and some of the work that's being done by the tobacco oompanies and others, so...",
"Do you know how many doctors are quoted in this artiole? A, Off the top of my head, I don't.",
"Okay. There's about 18 doctors, oorreot?","I mean, I see doctors being mentioned, so there's I'm sure there's a number of them."
Do you know how many of them are receiving grants and funding from the CTR?,"Off the top of my head, I don't know, but I!mean, I know that hundreds of doctors have received CTR grants, so... Q, Would -- would it surprise you if all of the doctors except for maybe one were receiving VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.vcritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.vcritext.com funding from the CTR who were quoted in this article?"
"Well, would that -- when you read the article was it disclosed anywhere in the artiole that these doctors who were being quoted were receiving funding and grants from the CTR?","I don't know if it was or not. I mean, I don't have an eidetio memory, so I can't say perfectly whether or not they did or not, but I i just don't know."
"Do you know how much between -- between and 1999, do you know how much ~~ how many millions of dollars in payments to the CTR for special funding came from the tobacco companies?",Are you asking me about special projects oif are you asking me about grant and aid funding? Because I know in grant and aid over 300 million dollars was -- was granted to a variety of doctors --
For example -- VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,"and universities, et cetera? Q, For example, this article I'm going to read you the names of a couple of doctors and see iff you know whether they were receiving funding from the CTR for the tobacco industry. Joseph Wolfe, Dr. Berkson, Dr. Ronald Fisher, Professor Alexander Brownlee, Dr. Ferdinand Helwig, Djr. Thomas Burford, do you know if these doctors i who were quoted in this article were all receiving f jinding from the CTR?"
Okay. And was that disclosed and was tjiat disclosed in this artiole?,"I don't know if it was or is or isn't. Iidon't recall it, but they may have mentioned CTR in here. I just can't, you know, off the top of my i h^ad remember. They may not have."
"If you'll just read the last -- and Dr. Strickman, do you know if Dr. Strickman was receiving money from the CTR?","Was he? Are you asking me was he? 0. Yeah, do you know?"
"Okay. Can you read the last paragraph of VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2179-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com ...f J**K the of the article into the reoord, please.","Maybe Doctor Strickman's new filter will solve the health problems [sic], if it exists, for America's 70 million smokers. Maybe not. At the moment, all we can say for sure is that the cause of cancer is not known and that there's absolutely no proof that smoking causes human cancer."
"And that was the artiole that was -~ the statements in the artiole that was proofread by the tobacco industry before it was published, oorreot?",
"And none of that was disclosed, oorreot?",
"And if we can go to the next exhibit, PT06000, which is Exhibit 15. Doctor, before we do that -- the next press release. Isn't it true, Doctor, that the I'm sorry. You oan go ahead -- I'm sorry, strike that. So PT06000, what is this?","It says, copy of American Cancer Society News release issued March 1968 New York City."
"And so this is a press release from the American Cancer Society that came out after this article in True Magazine about this artiole, oorreot?",
"And it came out about two months after the artiole was published and disseminated through the mailings, correct?","Mailings I don't know. Certainly after the artiole came out. It was in January, I believe."
"And if you could read the the first VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com four paragraphs into the reoord, please.","It says, New York, New York, the American Cancer Society today issued a detailed refutation of a Tobacco Institute promotion claiming that ""there is absolutely no proof that smoking causes human cancer."" In its statement the Society congratulated The Wall Street Journal for exposing, quote, the real source, end quote, of, quote, a devious mailing to tens of thousands of physicians, lawyers, schoolteachers and many others. The expensive mailing is a reprint of an artiole that appeared originally in True Magazine and is entitled ""To Smoke Or Not to Smoke - That is Still the Question."" The author is Stanley Frank, recently employed by Hill & Knowlton, one of the publio relations firms for the Tobacco Institute. In the mass mailing to physicians, teachers and others there is no reference to the cigarette industry role in the entire project."
"So the the involvement of Stanley Frank to the tobaooo industry was revealed, not by the tobacco industry, but by The Wall Street Journal, correct?",That's what this says.
And then following this press release did VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.verilext.com 212-490-3430 w in i m i O l o CD CD http://www.verilext.com the tobaooo industry come forth and issue an apology for trying to mislead the public?,
"Okay. So as you sit here today as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, you don't believe that this True Magazine artiole was misleading; is that what you're telling us?",
You don't believe it was just a massive propaganda effort?,
"Okay. Can you read -- can you read the second to last paragraph, please.","""What is presented as a mailing to community leaders by the owners of True is now exposed as a massive propaganda effort by the tobacco industry."""
"In the artiole, did I know we talked about you don't know who received funding and who didn't receive funding -- was it ever disclosed that the people who were saying smoking didn't cause cancer or wasn't proven that they cause cancer represented a minority, extremely small minority, of the scientists at that time?",In 1968?
Yes.,I don't know if it was necessarily a small minority. It was a minotity I think at that time.
Okay. Can you read the last paragraph.,"Mr. Frank names a small number of individuals in science and medicine who claim that the case against cigarettes is unproved, but the Cancer Society points out that ""by doing so, he gives the impression that the scientific community is seriously divided in judgment."" VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Mr. Frank fails to note, according to the ACS, that his ""sources"" constitute a minority -- and an extremely small minority, at that -- among those who have considered the question. The Society cites the ""host"" of organizations, both hero and abroad, including voluntary as well as government agencies that have ""indicated cigarette smoking as a serious health hazard."" Q, Sir, isn't it true that the tobacco industry through the Tobacco Institute was making misleading statements to the publio in order to promote the sale of cigarettes?"
"Okay. The next exhibit, Exhibit 2130, which is Exhibit 16, if you could turn to that one. Do you see that?",I do.
And who is Earle Clements?,I'm not sure who Earle Clements is* I read this this is a Tobaooo Institute document. I'm not ssuro who Earlo Clements is. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com
"Okay. And it's a memo from the desk of William Kloepfer, who is the vice president of PR for the Tobacco Institute, oorreot?",That is oorreot.
"And on the baok of it he CCs a host of people, including Blalook, Jim Bowling, Frederick Haas, Addison Yeaman, et cetera, et cetera, correct?",Yes.
"And so you just told me that you didn't believe that the tobaooo company was making statements to ~~ misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes, correct?",That is correct.
"Can you read the second para Number into the record from this memo, please?","It says, our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subjeot to the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that we are making fMlse or misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes."
"Dr. Figlar, if the tobacco industry through the Tobacco Institute or otherwise was making false statements or was making misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarottoD as VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c this memo suggests, you would agree that would be wrong, don't you?",I would.
"And that would be highly improper, knowing how deadly oigarettes are and knowing how many youths in our in our society are smoking, oorreot?",Are you asking me why? Are you asking for my opinion?
"Yeah. I'm asking your opinion, as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, why would it be wrong to mislead the American public in order to promote the sale of oigarettes; do you khow why?",
"Okay. They should not lie to to make pjtofits, correct?",
"And they should not lie to make profits, especially when they're selling a deadly product that can kill people, right?",
"Right. But the the the actual result of lying would be different if you were lying about selling a piece of paper or whether ybu're selling a product that has 70 carcinogens or nicotine in it, you understand the difference, VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Doctor?",
Right.,period.
"But most most companies who make deadly products know they shouldn't lie about it, right?",
"Right. And if a company that made deadly products was lying about it, why would that be wrong? That's what I want to know, Do you know why that would be wrong?",
"And people and if people rely upon the lies and are misled they can die, right? Do you know that?",
"Right. If the lying and the misleading leads leads people to continue using a deadly product, that's a problem, right?",
And that's why R. J. Reynolds shouldn't do that?,
"And the next exhibit, Exhibit VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 en *s) o http://www.veritext.com **4i- **+-*t **' *""utH1'1**^**'''**> n4<w)H'lii'*'i 'im<m t##H>WWII|llB c c Exhibit -- I'm sorry -- Number -~ it's 1941, which is Exhibit 17?",Okay.
Do you have that?,I do.
"And again, that's a memo to William Kloepfer, Jr., from the Tobacco Institute, correct?",It is.
"From Carl Thompson dated October 18th, 1968, correct?",Yes.
"And they're discussing in here Tobaooo and Hoalth Research Reports, oorreot?","Yes, they are."
And what are Tobaooo and Health Research Reports?,"I think, as I recall, these are cbnglomerations of scientific and other articles written about the subject."
"Okay. And again, the ~- the publio health is still should still be paramount to the tobacco industry, correct?",The most important type of story is that which casts doubt on the cause and effect theory of disease and smoking.
And that is and we can go back and talk about -- who was the primary audience for these reports?,I'm not I guess it says go out to doctors and scientists.
"Okay. And the secondary audienoe is the news media, correct?",That's correct. That's what it says here at least.
"And in Paragraph -- Paragraph B they're talking about the oriteria for selection within theso Tobacco and Health Research Reports, oorreot?","That i s the name of the ejection, y o s . VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY - www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 ***MM4h**niWMpMfMMrtl en KI o http://www.veritext.com c"
And if you could just read the first paragraph without the bullet points into the -- without the examples.,"Without the examples? 0, Yes."
"Okay. So they're talking about the type of stories that they want to include within these tobacco research reports that they're disseminating to doctors and scientists and the news media, correct?",
"And so they want reports that are indicating other factors other than smoking that may be involved with causing disease, correct?",That would be that's what it cays one VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 cn o http://www.veritext.com of the criteria could be.
"And then they're talking about in Number and 3, they're they talk about being interested in stories -- read 2 and 3 the type of -- those two types of stories that they're interested in in finding. A, I'm sorry. I'm not following. What did you say, 2 or 3?",
"Under examples under examples, the second and third example, if you oould read those into the record, I want to ask you about those.","Oh, okay* The second --* just the second ahd just the third, not -~ not the whole thing. In one --"
Yeah.,One in which death certificates or classifications of such a disease are questioned. Ahd Number 3 is one showing that many lung cancers may be metastatic from some other organ.
"Okay. So they're looking for articles that are written which questioned death certificates and also other articles that say that lung cancers may be metastatic from other organs, correct?",
"And then if you go to Page 2 again, and when they talk about these type of stories, if you oould read that again into the record, the first sentence?",
"So is it your understanding, as the corporate representative from R. J. Reynolds, was that they wanted reports to publish which showed that lung cancers may be metastatic from other organs in order to cast doubt on the cause and effect theory of smoking and disease, that was one o|f the things they were trying to do?","Well, that's what's stated in this in this sentence here. Of course, I think the industry believed that that that question was n >t settled, and therefore, they wanted to have VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2J79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com that view known because they didn't believe that people were informed about other possible avenues oh how the association could be looked at."
"So you think they were trying to be honest ahd forthright again with the publio, correct?",
"And then if you could read under Important: Subsection B, can you read that into the record, please.","I'm I'm sorry. Where where are we, Pjage 2 still?"
Yeah. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,Under Writing?
Headline; do you see that? Headlines.,Read headlines?
Yes.,"Headlines: There should be -- these should be very carefully written on the premise that doctors and scientists, like other readers, often grab information from the headlines and nothing more. Thus, the headline should strongly call out the point -- controversy! Contradiction! Other factors! Unknowns! Q, Well, they actually have all those with exclamation points, oorreot?"
"So they're saying the headlines should strongly call out the point that there's a controversy, contra -- contradiction, other factors ox unknown, oorreot?",That is what they're suggesting here.
"And in doing so, they're looking for sltories including stories in which death certificates are questioned, oorreot?","That -- that was one of the potential criteria, yeah."
"And they're looking for stories that show VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com that -""~ that -""* that *-** that tell the public that lung cancers may be metastatic from other organs, correct?","That was another one of the several criteria written there, yes."
"Doctor, you're a scientist, you know that most unknown primary lung -- most unknown lung -- most unknown primaries that are found in the lung are actually lung cancer primaries, oorreot?",
Did you ever learn that most unknown primaries turn out to be lung primary?,
Why would it be important for the Tobacco institute or the tobaooo industry to oall out controversy -- controversy and contradiction in newspaper articles or or scientific articles that say lung cancer may have come from an unknown primary?,
"But if we can go back to Exhibit 16 then again, which is 2130, where they talked about our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subject to the charge and may be subject to the finding that we are making false statements or misleading statements to promote the sale of ctigarettes; do you remember we spoke about that?","Well, that's what they're suggesting theit VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212- 79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com this is what people may say about us, but that doesn't mean that's what it was. They're actually warning and saying, you khow, they're people are probably going to come out and say that we're -- we're making stuff up, but that doesn't mean that that's true."
"Well, that's what -- that's what actually happened, actually in the Engel trial you were actually found to have done that, right?",
Right?,
You know that. We have spoken about that before.,"Look, I'm aware of the findings, but I don't know that the that the findings from a jury are really the same thing as what is happening ih the scientific community and the serious questions around cause and effect relationships, how that's viewed, how that's determined, shifts in scientific thought. That is not the same thing."
"Well, that sounds pretty complicated the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com way that you're putting it, Doctor, but the truth is, it wasn't only the Engel jury, but it went all the way up to the Florida Supreme Court and the Engel findings were were were actually affirmed, were they not?",
"Well, so in 1968 when this individual was writing that our position in the controversy may be sjubjeot to the finding that we're making false and misleading statements to promote sale of oigarettes, my question to you is: If they were, in faot, making false and misleading statements to typo of conduct from such a big industry?",
Was it money? Were they motivated by,
"Okay, But remember the Frank Statement that the public health was paramount, remember we sf>oke about that?","I do, yes."
"So between 1953 and 1968, do you know how much money the industry was making at the same time knowing how many people were dying; do you know that?",
The next exhibit is Exhibit 18. It's in one of those press releases. Were you able to pull t^ose out? It's PT05504-0224?,
"The next document, Dr. Figlar, is Exhibit 19, which is PT0719; do you see that?","I have it. Q, And, Doctor, you agree I'm going to go over some press release statements with you in a moment, okay?"
And you would agree the people making the press release statements on behalf of the Tobaooo Institute and the tobacco industry generally would have more knowledge about smoking and disease than the average smoker; would you agree with that?,"I don't know that I can speak for the Tobacco Institute. I can certainly speak fbr R. J. Reynolds, and I would say the people at R. J. Reynolds would have more knowledge."
"Okay. And when statements were being made tb the public about smoking and disease, it was the djisire of R. J. Reynolds and the industry that the public hear the statements, listen to the information and hopefully they would believe it, r{i.ght? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",
"And it would be wrong to issue publio statements for the purpose of -- of creating doubt, right?","I think it would be wrong if the if they did not believe that those statements were real or credible, but I don't know that there's anything wrong with creating doubt if you believe that doubt should be in question. If there's a if there's a subject matter that you think there's there's controversy around or that you think is still being djsbated, then I don't think there's anything wrong with -- with offering other sides of an opinion in an argument. I don't think there's anything wrong with that."
"Okay. So, again, you know the Frank Statement, R. J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute indicated that the publio health is paramount to all other concerns of their business, right?","That is what the Frank Statement said, y0o, that is correct.

"And you know that a cigarette we know --we know that a cigarette -- well, we know back in the '50s and '60s it was being claimed by many eminent scientists that cigarettes were causing the deaths of hundreds and thousands of American citizens, oorreot?",
"Right. But when -- when you're making a produot that's deadly that people are or could be dying from, you agree you've already agreed that the public health is paramount to any other concern, right?","We -- they did -- they did state that, yes."
"And you want to be cautious in the type of things that you're asking the public to rely upon VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com mbtmtmmmmmwmtm when there is concern that your produot is killing people, don't you?",

"Doctor, when you tell the truth do you think it's important to tell the whole truth or hjalf truths?",
"The whole truth, right?",Sure.
"So, if doctors are coming forward and saying it might not be known that smoking causes ljung oancer, but those same doctors are receiving finding from the CTR, do you think it's important VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212479-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com W M ^ ^ M ^ J + M W I T * !

People like --,"-- their research, so"
-- R. J. Reynolds --,I don't see why that's an issue.
"Well, if there were scientists at R. j. Reynolds who believed that smoking caused liing cancer in the 1950s and '60s, don't you think it's important to let the publio know that those sbientists in your company had those beliefs back then?",
"So, Doctor, you believe as you sit here under oath today, you believe that in the '50s and '60s of all of the scientists, all the researchers at R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco Company, there weren't any that believed stnoking caused lung cancer, right?",
Is that what you believe?,
"Okay. First of all, Doctor, we've already discussed the BAT document earlier in this disposition where they interviewed people from the Tfc and R. J. Reynolds; do you remember that?",I do.
"Okay. So I'm not going to rehash that with you right now. I think that would be a waste of time. We also know from prior trials you've seen documents, have you not, where R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson have destroyed documents. Have you seen those documents?",
"Okay. So my point is we know that outside of R. J. Reynolds, and outside of Brown Williamson, and outside of American Tobacco, there were scientists in our country, many of them who believed smoking caused lung cancer, oorreot?","I would agree there were, yes."
"And there were millions of Americans who believed that smoking caused lung cancer, correct?",I don't think there's any question. I believe that is correct.
"So are you saying but despite all the people outside of R. J. Reynolds, are you saying there was no scientist or researcher within your cbmpany who had the belief that smoking oaused lung cancer?",I can't speak
"Were they not allowed to have that belief? If they worked for your company, were they not allowed to have that belief?",
Show me --,"I'm sorry, but that is I'm not finished with my answer. But that is the point that I'm trying to make. The scientists within Reynolds did net believe that it was appropriate to change the means by which cause and effect relationships should be established, nor could the scientists at Reynolds determine what types of causative agents would be responsible to have that cause and effect relationship. They oould find toxicants in smoke. They obuld find carcinogens in smoke, but they oould not find them in sufficient enough quantities to suggest that that it would cause human disease. There's a distinction in what I'm trying to say bjatween establishing cause and effect relationship, which is what TI was talking about, and what I was talking about in terms of what scientists believed ahd the belief that whether or not something might bo a danger. I think there's scientists that bblieved it could have> been a danger, certainly. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com"
"Okay. So where have you seen any press release or statement from the Tobacco Institute, the CTR or R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson or American Tobaooo where they came forward and they said, there are scientists in our company who believed that smoking oigarettes is dangerous and can cause lung cancer?","I mean, the TI said it oould be a cause. They they I mean, they they've said it on a! number of occasions. You sent video where it s^ys it may be or it may not be. You saw it in in the True article. It may be or it may not be. It was a question. They -- they -- they didn't know for sure, and in the absence of definitive proof, many scientists will default to say I don't know because that is -- that is the position that a lot of people would take. That may net be the same position that the publio health community had taken or that the publio health community should take, but that is the position of many scientists."
"Okay. Doctor, you're telling me that people came forward and said, hey, it may be, it may not be, I get that. We're going to go through those. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com nsaaen .***+-*** I*** H M H B I I M M M l K c I want to know the statement where R. J. Reynolds came forward and said, we have scientists working in our company who believe smoking caused lung cancer, when did you make that statement and where was it made for the first time?","I don't know that that that they were that they made that statement in this time frame. I know that Bowman Gray acknowledged the the statistical association in '64, and recognized that that was a problem. I've seen documents from Alan Rodgman saying that, in essence, as an operating premise, we should try to remove carcinogens from oigarettes so that that might be an issue. But I mean, I don't know a public statement per se that that would make that declaration."
"Doctor, when is the first time R. J. Reynolds publicly admitted that smoking causes lung cancer?",In that simple terminology in 2000.
"Prior to 2000 did R. J. Reynolds, the Tobacco Institute, Brown & Williamson or American Tobacco ever issue a statement where they told the public that there were scientists, working in your Ijaboratorios who hold the belief that smoking did VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 HI III M HI "" II cn si o http://www.veritext.com i*****mmmmmwM*tmimwm yjmm,^ c c cause lung cancer and may kill smokers prior to 2000? did thai",I don't know that. I don't know if they or did not.
"The best you oould do -- the olosest to t is that you have statements from the Tobacco Institute telling smokers that it may or it may not , no one knows, right?",
Okay. All right.,
Dr. Figlar --,"Yes, sir Q, I want to go back -- I want to go back through some of these press releases and publio statements that were being made by the Tobacco Institute, okay?"
"I want to have you look at Exhibit 18 and 20, which are PT05504-224 and PT5504-283. Do you have those in front of you?","I have 18 and 20. I don't have the other I don't have the PT designation, but I VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com *fc c c l have 18 and 20."
"Okay. So Exhibit 18, what is that, Dbotor?",This looks like a -- this looks like a piress release.
"Okay. And, again, that was a press release from who?",This one is from the from the Council for Tobacco Research.
"And this would be a -- and it was a statement made by Dr. Clarence Cook Little, obiPJ*eot?","It looks to be, yes."
"And he was the director of Council for Tobacco Research, correct?",I think he was the --he was at least at one time the head of -- of the CTR.
"Okay. So, again, this was a statement b^ing made to the publio that -- by a representative for the Tobaooo Institute, correct?","If it was published, yes. I mean, it is a press release, so the intent was that it would be a public statement. Whether it got published or not is a separate question, but yes, it would presume to be. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212479-9424 www.verltext.com 212-490-3430 Ol CD rO http://www.verltext.com"
"And it was sent for release at 6:30 p.m. Monday, February 3rd, 1963, oorreot?",'69.
"'69* And oan you read the first two paragraphs into the record, please?","I can. The the scientist who has been associated with more research in tobaooo and health than any other person declared today that, quote, there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking and any disease. ""The gaps in knowledge are so great that those who dogmatically assert otherwise - whether they state that there is or is not such a causal relationship - are premature in judgment. If anything, the pure biological evidence is pointing away from, not toward, the causal hypothesis."""
"And, again, that was a statement that you wanted the public and the consumers to believe, oorreot?","They would, yes."
And that was a a a - - and you would agree i t would be wrong i f they were i s s u i n g that statement for the purpose of i n s t i l l i n g doubt or confusion in the mind of smokers?,
"Well, is that the consequence that you wanted, you wanted the smokers to have doubt and opnfusion about the relationship between smoking and and serious diseases?",
Okay. But you -- you talked about the consequences. You you said if it was a consequence that there was doubt or confusion in the mind of the smokers that would be okay; is that what you're saying?,I'm not saying that it's whether -- it's okay or not. What I'm saying is the purpose of the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com statement may not necessarily be just to cause doubt for the sake of doing that. That may -- but having a controversy or maybe people doubting the other side of the argument may very well be a consequence.
Was that a desired consequence?,I think the desired consequence was to get this message out.
And the message being that there's no proof that smoking causes lung cancer?,
Okay. And so you -- you indicated before that there were people from the American Cancer Society and other public health organisations who were researching and were believing that smoking caused lung cancer; do you remember that?,"I believe that there that there were. There were certainly people from the American Cancer Society, but there were also people from National Cancer Institute that felt that the causal relationship was not established."
"All right. We're going to talk about that VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com in a moment, but there were people in the public health community who were putting out the message that smoking causes lung cancer in the '50s and '60s, oorreot?","I think in the '50s that that would there were those that thought that. I don't I don't know that too many went that far because of what needed to be established in order to determine that. In '64 that changed, but there were people that I think certainly believed that that was the case and were researching to try to generate enough proof to prove that."
When do you believe there was a scientific cbnsensus that smoking caused lung cancer?,
"Well, you know there's a difference between the word most and majority. Majority is more than 50 percent and most is almost everybody. So by the 1960s and 1970s do you think it was roost scientists or do you think it was just majority?",
"Okay. And as a product cigarette manufacturer do you agree, especially when you're saying the publio health is a paramount concern, that you should know at least as much about your product as people who are not manufacturing your product?",
Did R. J. Reynolds recognise and understand that it was risky to be smoking cigarettes in the '50s and '60s and '70s?,"I don't I don't know if they if they would make that statement. I know certainly in the '60s they recognized that there %ras r.n association VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c Jm*^. j between the statistical data and smoking. So I think that's probably a recognition of certainly the possibility that it existed. I've certainly seen scientific documents in Reynolds that we have gone over before that wbuld suggest that it would be appropriate to remove, if you can, certain toxicants in smoke. So they certainly recognised that the possibility existed."
"I want to know when did R. J. Reynolds when did R. J. Reynolds first appreciate, understand that if somebody smoked your product there were real significant risks that they oould get sick and die?",
"Okay. I don't think you answered it, so I'll move to strike again, but let's move on and and just go through these documents.",Okay.
"That might be the easier way to do it with you. The next exhibit is Exhibit 5504-283, which is Exhibit 20; do you have that?","I do. 0. And can you read the first paragraph of that press release? Well, that was a press release scheduled for Thursday, April 30th, 1970, by the Tobaooo Institute, oorreot?"
And can you read the first paragraph.,"Sure. It says, the Tobacco Institute declared today that the American Cancer Society is withholding significant data from scientific scrutiny in connection with an experiment which the Society claimed resulted in production of lung cancer in dogs with cigarette smoke."
"So the American lung cancer the American Cancer Society was saying smoking causes lung cancer and they were citing to an experiment wj.th dogs to -- to support that theory, oorreot?","In essence, yes, they had suggested -- actually the ACS had had a press conference to ahnounce the study and the results of the study, but they did not release the data."
Okay.,The scientific data that would support the conclusion in the press release.
"Right. And you wanted the American publio tb believe the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry, over the American Cancer Society, ebrreot?",
When did the tobacco companies first publicly provide their data or their public documents to the publio? When were your internal documents first made publio?,
"Sir, you're not answering my question. Ybu know that there were internal documents that you were forced to turn over in the late 1990s, early 2000s, correct?",
Do you know when the tobaooo companies f^rst -- first put forward to the publio their secret confidential internal documents?,"Oh, I'm sorry, 6001? V J E R 1 T p X T R p p 0 R T I N G COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritextxom 212-490-3430 http://www.veritextxom"
"Yeah, Number 21.",Okay. Hold on.
And what is that dooument?,It looks again like a press release from tjie Tobacco Ins t i tu te .
"And hold on. What is can you tell me the date of it, Doctor?","It doesn't have a date, but the title is Tfie Tobacco Institute Believes the American Publio is Entitled to Complete, Authenticated Information i About Cigarette Smoking and Health. The American i Cancer Society Does Not Seem to Agree. But I don't spe a date on it, sir, but knowing the issue I gjiess around 1970. (Figlar Exhibit 22, Artiole titled The Question about Smoking and Health is Still a Question, reprinted from the Washington Post and other newspapers Tuesday, December 1, 1970, PT0664, was marked for identification.)"
"Okay. And the next document is PT -- is Exhibit 22, PT00664; do you see that? j VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",
Okay. What is that dooument?,This is another Tobacco Institute document.
"Okay. That was -- it's not a document. It was a newspaper ad taken out by the Tobacco Institute in December of 1970, correct?","That is correct. It is says on it it's newspapers, December 1st, 1970."
"And, again, that is a part of the propaganda from the Tobacco Institute to help shape public knowledge and publio opinions?","I mean, the -- the -- I don't know that I I'd call it propaganda, but it's certainly from the Tbbaoco Institute. It's an advocacy piece putting forth their issues."
"And can you read the headline, please.",After millions of dollars and over years of research the question about smoking and health is still a question.
"And the seoond paragraph, can you read that, please.","It says result. So far, in spite of this VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-^79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com ! pww*wM*'ii m*ii>iii* wiliiiiwpi MMM#iHiWiiiPi c c massive effort, there are eminent scientists who question whether any causal relationship has been proved between cigarette smoking and human disease i * Lnoluding lung cancer, coronary heart disease, or emphysema. They believe that years more of exhaustive investigation will be required to clear up do i what is indeed now a muddy picture."
What muddy picture are they referring to; you know?,
Okay. But that's not what they said. You VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol o CD O) http://www.veritext.com just said even today we don't know the exact mechanism; do you remember saying that?,"I'm sorry? I'm sorry? Q, You -- you just said you said today we dcm't even know the exact mechanism; do you remember saying that?"
"I'm just asking if you remember I'm asking if you remember saying that, because that's not what the artiole says, is it? They're talking about something different, aren't they?",No. You asked me
"The artiole -- Doctor, the artiole says the artiole says there are eminent scientists who question whether there is any causal relationship has been proved between cigarette smoking and human disease, right?",Right. And so when you asked me the question as to why
"This artiole is telling the public in sjpite -- Doctor, let me finish -- so this artiole its telling the publio in spite of this massive effort there are eminent scientists who question VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)79-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com whether there is any causal relationship has been proved between cigarette smoking and any human disease, correct?","It says that, yes, that is oorreot."
"And then on the the third to last paragraph it goes on to say the work should go forward and you can read those two paragraphs, pjLease,",I'm sorry? All the way down to the end? $t> you don't want me to -- never mind. So the last tfio paragraphs?
"No, the second there are eminent scientists, if you oould read that and the last -- tfio next one.","You've lost me. I'm sorry. Q, There are eminent scientists who believe tfiat the question of smoking and health is an open one and the research in this area must go forward. Did I read that correctly?"
Okay. At the very end --,Okay.
"At the very end where i t says the work s h o u l d go f o r w a r d - - VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c ""v,.",Okay.
do you see that?,"Thank you. Yes, I do."
"And then it says, from the beginning, the tobacco industry has believed that the American people deserve objective scientific answers; did I rtad that correctly?","Yes, you did,"
"And you would agree with me, Doctor, that the American public, especially smoking consumers, were entitled to have objective, honest answers, don't you?",Yes. Sure.
"And this this artiole, this research was actually sent to all the congressmen in Washington, wasn't it?","It may have been. I don't know if it was or was not. I know it says it's a reprint from the Washington Post, so 1 don't know if it got sent out further than that. It may have."
"But regardless, sir, isn't it true that the CTR -- well, the CTR at that time was actually only interested in evidence to support their denials that smoking causes disease?",
"Okay. Let's look at the next exhibit then, it's 1807, which is Exhibit 23. Do you have it?",I do. Is this --
"And this is a memo from Cullman to Wakeham [jsic], correct?",It is.
"And they're discussing in this meeting -- in this memo a November 30th meeting with the CTR executive committee, oorreot?",That is oorreot.
"And they're talking about the -- the -- t^e stated objective or purpose of the CTR, correct, in this memo?","That is a that is a heading, yes."
"And so if we could go through it and read, it says - - d o you see in the first paragraph it s^ye what kind of CTR program is boct for the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 IMM^dt^lttKflphMM""**""* ^ J o O http://www.veritext.com industry. Did I -- do you see that?",That's in the f i r s t paragraph from the t*>p?
"Yeah, second sentence it says --","That's right. 0* ~~ the question, what kind of CTR program is best for the industry; do you see that?"
Okay. Can you read the rest of that paragraph into the record?,"It says, at the meeting it was apparent this question is troubling many elements of the industry to the extent people are reluctant to djtscuss the subject openly because of the diversity i ojf views. To some extent this unsettled state also exists within Philip Morris. In the hopes of clarifying, at least partially, the matter I offer tjie following summary, hastily adding that these"
Okay. And then it goes on to say the stated objective or purpose of CTR; do you see tfiat? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-^79-9424 www.verhext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.verhext.com,"I do. 0. Okay. And so they're saying what is what is the purpose that we're stating that we're telling people of CTR is, and can you read that first sentence of what the stated purpose is?"
"So that's the stated purpose, that they're telling the public of what the CTR is supposed to do, correct?","Well, I mean, it's both, isn't it? It says, stated objective or purpose of the CTR."
"Okay. And then if you oould read the last sentence of that Number 1 heading, in any oase?","In any oase, this statement of purpose does not reveal the -- the objective need of the industry in supporting the CTR program."
And if you can go on and read the first four sentences of the next paragraph.,"Two, it has been stated that CTR is a program to find out ""the truth about smoking and health."" What is what is the truth to one is false to another. CTR and the industry have publicly and frequently denied what others find as VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com r C C c ""truth."" Let's faoe it."
"Okay. Let's face it and the next paragraph -- I mean, sentence.",We are interested in evidence which we believe denies the allegation that cigarette sftoking causes disease.
"Okay. So where in that -- in that statement where they're talking about the objective ahd purpose of CTR, and they're discussing we are interested in evidence we believe denies the allegation that cigarette smoking causes disease, where in there do they discuss that the publio health is still a paramount concern of theirs?",
"Okay. And then it goes on on Option B, they're talking about things of what they can use the CTR for, oorreot?",
"What is Option B, what arc if you can VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 oi o http://www.veritext.com read that first paragraph and tell the jury what they're talking about.","It says, Option B, use the CTR program as a means of establishing expert scientific witnesses who will testify on behalf of the industry and legislative halls, in litigations, at scientific meetings, and before the press and the publio."
"Okay. But you just told me previously or you told the jury that the stated -- stated objective was to aid and assist research in tobacco ahd health, correct?","That was what was disoussed here, but of course, this is a memo, which is talking about a meeting as to what we should do with the CTR. 0. Right,"
"Right. So one of the things they're purporting to do is not -- they're not talking VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com about assisting with research, but they're talking about establishing expert witnesses who will support the industry, oorreot?",
"Wakeham Wakeham was at the meeting, correct, with the CTR, oorreot?","I think he said he was at the meeting, yfrs."
"Okay. And he's reiterating in this memo what took place at the meeting with the CTR, correct?","He was trying to sum up, as we read in the first paragraph, what kind of ideas were thrown around. Remember, he said --"
And they were talking,I offer hastily these statements embody many ideas from many places.
"Right. And they wrcs talking about uoing Yj ]yjjj 'P REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com IMIMHH m<imim the CTR program to establish expert witnesses in litigation and in legislative halls, correct?",That's what they were saying in Option B there; that is correct.
"And in the second paragraph, if you could r^ad the last sentence, please.","One one might also question how long it would take for the witnesses to acquire the ""taint"" of industry money."
Do you know what that means?,"I think I can I think I oan understand in*, yean."
What does that mean?,"Well, I mean, I think it it means the same for anybody. So if you're -~ certainly if you're being paid by the industry, then there's always the question of whether or not you're just solely acting in their interest. I mean, it's the same thing that you guys mtist face with your expert witnesses, the same reason why you ask me questions about* where I'm getting paid. So anybody who is paid to be a spokesman, I think, will have that question asked of them. So, I mean, just like with your witnesses ajnd the same here, I would think. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212479-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com r r c i"
"Okay. Well, respectfully, I don't think I asked you if you were getting paid. If I did, I forgot that. But I'm talking about the CTR, most respectfully. The CTR the point I think of the m^mo is, is the CTR has a stated purpose to aid and assist research into tobaooo and health, oorreot?","That is the that is the -- that is what it was there for, yes."
"And in the memo that we're talking about using the CTR funds and in the memo first they're talking about that they're interested in evidence whioh denies the allegation that smoking causes disease, oorreot, we talked about that?",
"And then in the memo they're also talking about using the CTR program to establish witnesses, oorrect?",
"Over all other interests or involvement over all other interests of the industry, oorreot?",
And if you could read the first par -- the first sentence in the conclusion of this document then.,"The first sentence says, it would seem appropriate to explore in some depth during the next year or two how CTR is or might be serving the needs of the cigarette industry."
"So the CTR nowhere in its stated purpose does it say that they were going to use the CfcR to serve the needs of the tobaooo industry, do ttxey?",
"So now they want to use the CTR to -~ to serve the tobacco needs as opposed to the publio health interests, oorreot?",
"Well, the other purpose is the needs of the cigarette industry, correct?",
"Right, whether right. They've got to l^ok at whether or not the CTR is actually giving a benefit to the industry as opposed to the people who are dying?",
"Exactly. That's the point in the whole memo which talks about the meeting; they don't talk about -- there's no mention about an interest in helping people who might be dying, is there?","Well, I mean, I think they -- they they felt they said off the hook, yeah, but, I mean, they're aotually saying that there's probably, if there's more research, that they might find other ottusoB to smoking [sic], so they certainly are issuing forth the idea that they don't believe cigarette smoking is related to that, at least at that time."
"Sir, most respectfully, do you know what percentage of lung cancers are caused from smoking?",Do I know today? I think so. I think it's over 90 percent.
"Exactly. So if we were to look today for other causes we oould find other causes, couldn't we?","There are other causes, yes."
"Right. So if I wanted to publish other causes, I could do that today if I wanted to, right?",
"Right, So the tobacco industry was using the CTR to look for other causes instead of looking to establish the relationship between smoking and Hing cancer, right?",
Right.,"So, in other words, they were saying that they don't necessarily believe that smoking would be the cause of certain diseases. Q, Right. Because they wanted to be off the hook and they wanted to have the needs of the cigarette industry served, correct?"
"Okay. And so we oan go on to the next exhibit, Dr. Figlar, is Exhibit 25, which is 5&04-285 [sic], which is Exhibit 25; do you have that? f\. ies, sir.",
And what is that document?,This looks like a press release from TI.
And when was that scheduled for release?,February the 26th. I'm looking for a year. Do you see a year?
"1971, correct?",I don't know. I don't have the year on here.
"Okay. The one I have says March -- May 25th, 1971.",
5504-285.,"I know. I d o n ' t have - - I d o n ' t hcvve VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com those numbers. Are you talking about Exhibit 24 or 25? 24, I have May 25, 1971. But 25 is"
"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Exhibit 24. I:apologize.",Okay.
I apologize.,For those press releases I don't have them in the little packets. So I don't have the numbers.
Okay. No problem. My fault.,That's all right.
"Do you have Exhibit 24, Doctor?","Yes, I do."
And what is that?,"It is a Tobaooo Institute press excuse m, press release."
Okay. And it was released -- it was scheduled for release when?,"May the 25th, 1971."
"And again that was another opportunity for the Tobaooo Institute or the tobaooo industry to set forth facts for the American publio to rely upon, correct?",
"Right. And the message that you're putting forth the tobaooo industry can choose to put forth a message to help people, oorreot?",
"Right, but they oould put forth they hkve an opportunity in these press releases to put forth a message to help consumers, can't they, if they wanted to, if they chose to?","I would think so, yeah. 0. Okay. So then we can go to the second p^ige of this press release, and if you oould read the second and third paragraph into the record, please."
"And that's what the tobacco industry wanted, they wanted millions of Americans to continue to smoke and believe that there was still an open question, didn't you?",
"Right. And they wanted well, it says here many scientists, many eminent scientists or workers in the field agree that the question of smoking and health is still very much a question. Ahd so apparently do millions of Americans who continue to smoke, and that's what you wanted, isn't it? That's what R. J. Reynolds wanted, that's what the TIRC wanted, the TI, the CTR, they wanted Americans to think that it was still a question and to continue to smoke, didn't you?",
"Right. Right. But you when you put forth a press release I guess my simple question is this. We can do it the long way. Obviously you're putting forth press releases that you want the American publio to think are honest statements, right?","Of course, yes."
"And obviously you're putting forth press releases that you want people to believe are true statements, right?",
"And you're putting forward publio you're putting forth press releases of statements that you want people to believe are true, believe yp>u and rely upon thorn as true faots, don't you? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com","I would I would think that they would. I mean, I would think that when you put out a press release that, you know, people have the chance to rely on that as well as a lot of other information that's available. They certainly want it to be in the consideration set."
"Sure. They wanted they wanted, as they seid in this press release, they wanted there to be an open question which millions of Americans still believe in and have those millions of Americans still smoking, right?",They didn't --
Right. There was a question. It wasn't yet established that smoking caused lung cancer is what thd message was that you wore relaying to your VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 ' www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com consumers?,"For many scientists, that is correct, that'8 what they said, and they stated that."
"Okay. Okay. And in the next exhibit, which is Exhibit 25, which is PT05504-249, that was from February that's a press release from February 26th, 1972, correct? A, This is the one I was looking at before. I don't know that I see I see '72 in reference. But I don't know if that's -- I don't know if the press release was from --",
"Well, it's a February 26th press release where they're talking about here today?","Yep. Q, They're talking about"
"probably '72, oorreot?",You got it. That's correct.
Can you read the first paragraph of that press release into the record?,"I can. It says, Little Rook -- J.C.B. Ehringhaus, Jr., vioe president and counsel fpr the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, said here today that the 1972 report of the Surgeon General to Congress on smoking and health, quote, VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com M n^, i ( <iiw>#i mmw* H ii*wiifc>i """"""s c y**l*s insults the scientific community, end quote, and that the, quote, number one health problem is not cigarette smoking, but is the extent to which public health officials may knowingly mislead the American publio, end quote."
"So in this press release, the publio health officials are being criticized by the Tobacco Institute for knowingly misleading the American public about smoking and health issues, cbrreot?","That is what this particular release says. Whether or not this is -- actually went out the door or not, I don't know, or whether it was picked up, but that's what this release suggests. It m^y -- may even be a draft. I don't know."
"And that would be wrong for anybody to mjlslead the American publio about smoking and health, correct?","I mean, I think -- I think in general it would be, yeah."
"And yet you're accusing the Surgeon General and the public health officials of doing it, not the tobacco industry, right?",
"All right. You agree though tha.t by VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com issuing press releases like these, that you would that you or the tobacco industry when I sey you I mean the tobacco industry -- would be creating doubt in the minds of smokers as to whether smoking did, in fact, cause cancer?","I don't know if there if they would necessarily be creating doubt, but I mean that is a possible consequence. They're certainly bringing up the point that there's another side to the story that the Tobaooo Institute and the industry didn't feel was getting appropriate air time which is why they released these press releases."
"But wasn't creating doubt not just a consequence, but an actual strategy of the tobacco ihdustry?","I don't know that it necessarily was. I know we're looking at documents earlier.that make those kind of statements, but I don't know that I don't know that that was neoessary based on scientifically what was occurring. (Figlar Exhibit 26, Memo dated 5/1/72 to Horace R. Kornegay from Fred Panzer, Subject: The Roper Proposal, PT02050, was marked for identification)"
"Okay. Well, let's look at the next dooument, which is PT02050, which is Exhibit 26.",I'm 2050 did you say?
"2050, which is Exhibit 26, yeah.",Okay.
Do you have that document?,I do*
And do you know do you know who Horace Kornegay is?,I've heard the name. I've seen this before.
Okay.,"I've seen this dooument before. I think this is all I think, again, this is a TI dpoument."
"Okay. And it's dated May 1st, 1972, correct?",Correct.
And can you read the f i r s t two paragraphs?,"Yes. I t ' s i t i s my strong b e l i e f that w& now have an opportunity to take the in i t i a t i ve* VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com in the cigarette controversy, and start to turn it around. For nearly twenty years, this industry has employed a single strategy to defend itself on three majors fronts -- litigation, politics, and public opinion."
"Okay. So this is almost 20 years after the Frank Statement, oorreot?",Almost*
"And it's talking about how they defended themselves in in court rooms, in Congress, legislative halls and in the public opinion, correct?","That's what he suggests, we have a single strategy to merely defend itself on three fronts, y^a."
"And can you read the next paragraph with the first the first indent there, with that next paragraph?","It says I'm sorry. Do you -- while the strategy, is that what you're asking me, starting with while the strategy?"
"Yeah, that paragraph and you see there's one underneath it where it talks about creating doubt. If you oould just read up to the sentence th&t talks about creating doubt and through that VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-479-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com sentence.","Okay. It says, while the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us win important battles, it is only fair tb say that it is not - nor was it intended to be ~ a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy, consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it."
"Okay. So do you agree, Dr. Figlar, that t^at would have been wrong for 20 years to have a hblding strategy to create doubt about the health charges knowing that consumers are dying?",
"Okay. Because you weren't -- you weren't ait all the meetings back in the '60s and '70s, but Horace Kornegay was, right?",
"No, but you weren't -- you weren't party tc any of the meetings that were taking place for which these memos are drafted to address, were you?","I was not party to, no."
"Okay. The people who were involved were people like Horace Kornegay, Fred -- Fred Panzer, William Kloepfer,'correct?","I don't know the whole histories of these guys, but my assumption is when they wrote the memos they were involved in these in meetings ahd whatnot, so, yeah, I mean, I -*"""
"So there were if there were meetings where they concluded for 20 years that they've been involved in a holding strategy to create doubt about the health charges while people were dying, do you agree that would have been wrong to do?",
"So you think that Horace Kornegay writes this memo to Fred Panzer that's not true, he puts all this stuff in writing, is that what you're saying, that he's putting all this untruthful stuff in a memo to Fred Panzer?","No, it's from Fred -- so Fred Panzer wrote it. It's to Horace Kornegay. You were suggesting that --"
Let me rephrase it because I asked it wrong. Let me rephrase it and then you can answer.,Okay.
Are you alleging that Fred Panzer is putting all this stuff in a memo to Horace Kornegay a^d he's CCing on the memo a gentleman by the name of Kastenbaum and William Kloepfer and he's putting all this information in a memo which is false and n^t true?,Are you asking me whether or not he's falsifying the memo? I have no idea. All I'm suggesting is --
Okay.,"-- when you asked me the original question that -- that there were meetings to disouss this. All I'm saying is that this is a memo that Fred VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Penzer wrote suggesting a proposal for a variety of actions, and not necessarily that is that is a group of meetings that have took place over the course of 20 years. I don't know if Fred Panzer was around for 20 years or not when he wrote this memo, so I that's all I was trying to say. It is a memo. It exists. I understand it. I've read it before."
"Have you seen a memo from Horace Kornegay or William Kloepfer where they wrote back to Panzer and said, what the heck are you talking about? Where did you come up with that from?","No, not that -- not that I've seen. But I -~ what I do know what I recall about seeing this memo before is I don't think this constitutional hypothesis or multifactorial hypothesis that he talks about in there ever really w|snt anywhere, but"
Okay.,"so, I mean, I'm not saying that 0. It's a memo."
"okay. And then it goes on at the bottom, it says, on the litigation front for which the strategy was designed it has been successful; do ybu see that?","I do Q, Then i t says under p o l i t i c a l front , the strategy has helped make poss ible an orderly rfctreat; did I read that correctly? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 en o (O (O (O http://www.veritext.com M l c c c"
"And then on the next page, if you oould read into the record on the publio opinion front.","It says, on the public opinion front, however, our situation has deteriorated and will continue to worsen. This erosion will have an adverse effect on the other fronts because here is w$ere the beliefs, attitudes and aotions of judges, juries, elected officials and government employees are formed."
"Okay. So then they oome up with a a strategy, oorreot? Or they discuss a strategy, rght?","Again, there's no discussion. This is Fired Panzer writing a memo. So Fred Panzer wrote a memo and said here's what a strategy is."
"Okay. To Horace Kornegay, right?","Correct. Q, And you don't know -- you don't -- you don't know who either of those gentlemen are"
what position they hold or how high up they are?,"I'm sorry, I thought *-* I thought I told you that they were both this is an internal VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 M i HMWWMiillfclli Ol o (O (O ro o http://www.veritext.com Tobacco Institute document, I'm pretty sure*"
"And the the -- it goes on, if you oould read the first sentence of the next paragraph.","As an industry, starting there or the other one? Q, Yeah, yeah."
"That one, please, yes.","As an industry, therefore, we are obmmitted to an ill-defined middle ground which is articulated by variations on the theme ""the oase is net proven."" tsio) as the recent history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam"
"Doctor, Doctor, that that sentence that was the sentence I wanted to talk to you about.","Oh, I'm sorry."
"So being that the case is not proved, is that the theme that we've been talking about that we've been seeing in these press releases and public statements so far?","I believe that's the -"" I mean, that's the kiind of statement that would sum up what we believe the scientific situation was, so that is what has been stated, yeah.

"Okay. And then if you could read the next paragraph into the record, please.","Okay. In the *-~ in the cigarette controversy, that one?"
Yes.,The whole paragraph? Q* Yes.
"Okay. So they wanted the public to perceive, understand, and believe in evidence that smoking may not be a causal factor of lung cancer, correct?",
"And then it goes on, in the next page they telk about planning a scenario for aotion, correct?","There is, yeah."
"And it talks about selecting a panel of experts to consult on the design of a study, right?","Right, of the -~ that you haven't gone over, but yes, the design of a -- of a study, yes."
"And then if the results were favorable they were going to present them to members of the Senate, the House, the Cabinet, the White House, state governors, medical schools and university presidents and scientific bodies, oorreot?",That's what it suggests.
"And the next paragraph, would you read that. It kind of states what the purpose of all th i s i s.",
"Well, okay, does the next paragraph d i s c u s s what the purpose of t h i s i s ?","Well, I mean, I think i t does . I t ' s been a whi le s ince I ' v e read the document, but i t says , VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Oi W o o ro http://www.veritext.com yeah, the purpose is twofold, to gain support and then to neutralize any adverse action that may be brewing. I'm paraphrasing."
"Okay. Okay. And by the way, do you know whether -- whether Panzer was the vice president of the Tobacco Institute?",I don't know his position. I know this is an internal Tobaooo Institute document.
"Are you familiar with a film titled The Answers We Seek, which talks about the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial hypothesis that are discussed within this memo?","Am I familiar with that film? Not that I'm aware of, no."
"Okay. I think we might be seeing parts of it. Maybe I'm wrong. But in this memo they do discuss the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial hypothesis, oorreot?",They do.
And do you know what what the video N^ed to Know is?,"Do I know? I don't, unless you unless it's part of the clips you sent me I don't I haven't seen an awful lot of film. (Figlar Exhibit 27, Video titled Need to VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Know, was marked for identification.)"
Okay. Let me let me play it and show it to you. It's the next exhibit which would be Exhibit 27. It's a video PT01675AA. If we can play that and then I'll ask you some questions.,
"Okay. Dr. Figlar, do you know who that video was shown to?","Do I know whom? No. Q, Okay. As the R. J. Reynolds corporate representative with the most knowledge, do you know wjio put out that film?"
And do you know if the dootors who were quoted in that piece were actually receiving funding from the CTR?,"I don't.

"And the purpose would you agree that the purpose of that film was to shape public beliofs on smoking and health, and to give other possible alternatives for the cause of cancer?","I don't think there's any question that it was a TI advocacy piece and trying to put forth the ideas that the Tobaooo Institute and the tobacco industry had with regard to the data that they had at hand at that point in time in 1970 or '72,"
"And it was put forward as a credible, reliable piece of information. That's how it was -- it was portrayed, oorreot?","I mean - I think it's beyond portrayed. I think it was credible at the time and -- so, yeah."
Okay. And that's what they wanted smokers to believe at the time?,
"And that was consistent with the prior exhibit, the Panzer memo that we just spoke about where he's talking about putting forward a VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 o ro CD http://www.veritext.com ~t- multifactorial hypothesis that as science advances mere and more factors come under suspicion as contributing to the illness for which smoking is blamed and he talks about air pollution, et cetera, obrreot? That's on Page Page 2, the last paragraph of the second page,","Hold on. That is -- well, I mean -~ it's obviously a multifactorial hypothesis, yeah, I wbuld include that."
"And in addition to this setting forth film ahd press releases and newspaper ads the Tobaooo Institute was also contacting people direotly through mailings and letters, correct? A, They were, yes.",
"And some of the people that they were talking to and telling them that it hadn't been pjtoved that smoking causes disease were elementary school students, correct?",I believe if asked by elementary school students or principals they would respond.
"Do you think that was a good thing to do bjick in the 1970s, tell schoolchildren that it hasn't been proven that smoking causes lung oanoer?",
"Okay. So -- but in these letters when you responded you wouldn't -- you wouldn't set forth to the school school kids, you wouldn't say, hey, listen, there's a lot of scientists out there who believe smoking causes cancer, and we actually have scientists at R, J, Reynolds who believe that, too, but we're not 100 percent convinced. Was that what ybu were telling these school kids?","Absolutely, yeah."
"So did you learn when you were in school that there were 70 carcinogens in smoking, that if you started smoking you oould become addioted and that 50 percent of addicted smokers died, did you learn that in elementary sohool? A* I learned in elementary sohool that if you started smoking you would have a really hard time quitting. So I don't know that anybody said it was addictive in the '70s, but they certainly said it was dangerous and I saw pictures of diseased lungs and a whole host of other things growing up. So I've always known that smoking, or at least I always believed growing up that smoking was dangerous. I started grammar school I started kindergarten in '69, and I graduated high school in VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c X***"" Jfifrlt*.",
"All right. So based upon that information, you you've never smoked and you just went to work for a cigarette company?","Ko, I did start smoking later in my last year or so of high sohool, but I don't ever remember being having the tobaooo companies write to me in in Connecticut."
"Okay. So you started smoking in high school, Dr. Figlar?",I did when I was 17 or 18.
"Okay. And do you - - d o you know about why do you know what percentage of smokers start by age 18? A, I mean, I've seen a lot of -- I've seen a lot of public health statistics. Anywhere from -- I've seen as, I think, as low at about 70 to percent.",
"Okay. So up to 90 percent of all smokers start by the age of 18, like you did, oorreot?","I believe that is -- I mean, I've seen that, yes. (Figlar Exhibit 28, Letter dated 6/6/72 to Mrs. Sherry Fine from T. K. Cahill, PT01277, was marked for identification.)"
"And so the next exhibit, whioh would be Exhibit 28, whioh is 127 -- PT01277 is Exhibit 28. What is that dooument?",It's a 1972 document from public relations department*
okay.,I believe it's a Reynolds document.
"T. K. T. K. Cahill from the Tobacco Institute, oorreot?",I guess I don't know if it's TI or or Reynolds. Is that I think it's it's from -- it's from -- it's either from TI or from one of the companies
okay.,"It might very well be from TI. Q, But in the letter they're discussing the Tobacco the Council for Tobaooo Research, correct?"
"And they're talking about it's a letter to a Mrs. Fine, who seems to be a teacher for a second-grade class, correct?","It is. I mean, it says, thank you for your letter. So they're talking to Mrs. Fine who was a teacher. And it said that you requested VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com ^H'-ffH*-*m*^v*oi""*m^^*mH information on smoking and health. So they're responding. So Cahill is responding --"
Doctor --,-- to a letter written directly
". Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, slow down. Can you read the first paragraph into the record, please.","Certainly. It says, Dear Mrs. Fine, thank you for your letter of May 30th, enclosing letters written by members of your second-grade class requesting information on smoking and health."
"Okay. And then in the second paragraph it says, long before the present oriticism began, the tobacco industry, in a sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects, if any, smoking might have on human health, established The Council for Tobacco Research, oorreot?","You have read that correctly, yes. 0. And the third paragraph, if you oould read the first sentence into the record, please."
"And then they enclose materials for the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com mwmmmimmmmtt^u^mf^mk^m-. . _ j_u_ nLmnj, m n nn - T""r i -* * - ' second-grade class, correct?",The last sentence suggests there's enclosed materials.

"It's 29, 6002.",

Please.,"In all the research that has been going on, no study has reported finding any substance as found in cigarette smoke that causes human lung cancer or other disease. Those who glibly talk about removing ""the harmful substance"" often overlook the fact that not even the oigarette critics can name ""the harmful substance."" It is a fact that all of the diseases with whioh smoking has been connected also occur in nonsmokers. And this leaves a puzzle unsolved: what causes nonsmokers to get diseases which are claimed by some to be ""caused"" by oigarette smoking?"
"And if you can go to the next column and read the first two paragraphs, please.","The industry does not go along with those who would claim the ""issue is settled"" and shut off VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 ""I IIIWI'Iw Ol o (O o http://iMii.nnyww.Ma http://www.veritext.com c c X'N all discussion on the controversy.

Isn't it true though that it was being presented in the belief that full, free and informed discussion of the tobacco and health controversy is in the publio interest?","I'm sorry. You got a little garbled there. Can you repeat that? I apologize. I couldn't hear you. ft. This The Cigarette Controversy, these are these are part of the white papers, correct?"
And if you could turn to Page 1 and read on the left-hand side what the -- the purpose of this or how it's being presented?,"It says, this booklet is presented by the Tobacco Institute in the belief that full, free and informed discussion of the public *"" excuse me -~ full, free and informed discussion of the smoking and health controversy is in the publio interest, and in the conviction that the controversy must be resolved by scientific research, ft, And can you read the first two sentences under the preface."
"Okay. Doctor, do you know the exact mechanism of how smoking causes lung cancer today? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c r c",You can never know what an exact mechanism
"Okay, But today R, J. Reynolds and the industry admits that smoking causes lung cancer, correct?","We do. ft. And in the 1970s you did not know the exact mechanism, correct?"
"And i f you oould read the the f i r s t paragraph there , i f you could j u s t r ead t h a t i n t o 212-2t9-9424 VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol o o en http://www.veritext.com trie record.

First paragraph, throughout these years, answers have been slow in ooming, and paradoxically, theories about causes of illness have broadened as a result of researoh sponsored by many different sources. Heredity. Stress. Behavior. Air pollution. Viruses. Occupational hazards. Immunology. Things we eat. Things we drink. These and more, as well as the hypothesis hypothesis that tobaooo is at fault, occupy the interests of inquisitive scientists today. ft. And, again, so that statement there was a white paper that you were disseminating back to the Panzer memo again when they were talking about the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial hypothesis, correct? i"
All right. Let's go on to the next exhibit. It's Exhibit 34. And this is another p ress release and it's PT05504-259.,"Oh, sorry, okay. Yep."
"Okay, The next Exhibit is Exhibit 35, which is PT06007. Do you have that?",I do.
"Okay. And if you can go down where it talks about quality of investigators and the work done; do you see that? A, x see Xv, yes, ft. And can you read that Number 1 and 2, pjlease.","It says, the quality of investigators and the work done has improved dramatically because, one, targeted research; two, availability of i federal funds down so tobacco money ain't so dirty anymore. ft. Do you know why they would be referring to tbbacco money being dirty for investigators?"

"And that's what Dr, Koop wrote, the Surgeon General wrote, 11 years later in a Surgeon General report, correct?","He may have, but I mean, they they said that in '64 as well, similar statements, so... ft, And when did -- right. And so do you agree that nicotine' -- do you agree that nicotine is addictive, as is oooaine ahd heroin today?"
"And the next document, Doctor, is Exhibit 39, 1154, And, again, they're talking about Dr. Abood, and this is again -- if you oould r^ad the subject matter of this into the record, please,","I'm sorry.

"And he's with CTR, oorreot? I mean, he was with Brown Williamson, correct?",
"And the last big paragraph there, if you could read from originally and down one, two, three, four, five, six, seven linos, if you could VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c read from originally seven lines down to the word product into the record, please.","Okay. Originally, CTR was organised as a piiblic relations effort. The industry told the world CTR would look at the diseases whioh were bhing associated with smoking. There was even a suggestion by our political spokesman that if a harmful element turned up the industry would try to rt>ot it out. The research of CTR also discharged a l^gal responsibility. The manufacturer has a duty to know its product. ft. You would agree, though, Doctor, that the manufacturer does have a duty to know its product? A, I do. ft. And do you agree that the industry never t >ld the world that the CTR was merely a publio relations effort?"
"That's what you believe, right?","Based on what I have read and the research that I have done, I don't believe that CTR was solely a publio relations effort. There may have been publio statements made, but I don't believe that is completely the case. ft. Okay. But you don't believe it's completely the case. You believe it was partially the oase, I take it?"
"Okay. The next document is Exhibit 42. PIJP02211A. Do you have it, Doctor? #%> t X 0 9 f 9 X X *",
"And this is from November 13th, 1978, correct?","It is. Again, it's an Osdene memo from Philip Morris."

"And this is a dooument that was provided tb you to review in preparation for your deposition, correct?","Yes, and I believe I have reviewed it."
"Okay. Can you read Number 2 for the rfecord, please.","CTR should be controlled both legally and scientifically by representatives of the industry. Implicit in the above, the SAB should be oonsist constituted with a majority of industry members. Several outside members (but not a majority) should be nominated to the SAB.

What --was the public being told that tho C4?R was being controlled both legally and VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2V9-9424 www.vcfitcxt.com 212-490-3430 http://www.vcfitcxt.com scientifically by the industry?,
"And Number 3, oan you read Number 3?","CTR should fund work largely by means of contracts, thus reserving the right to control publications whioh might be detrimental to the industry."
Why would there be a recommendation to try to control research?,"Well, my guess would be that Mr. Osdene doesn't like the fact that the CTR was allowing people to publish stuff that they didn't like. So, again, why make a recommendation to do something if it's already being done? You wouldn't."
"Again, at the end where it talks about subjects to be avoided, what type of subjects did ttyey want the CTR to avoid doing research on, if VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 2i2-2?9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c you oould read Number 2?","Well, Number 2 says, attempt to relate human disease to smoking."
Do you know how many --do you know how many papers were published by funding by the CTR?,"I think in general I do, thousands of papers, if I'm not mistaken. Q, There are about 7,000, oorreot?"
And do you know how many of those papers that were published actually attempted to relate hyman disease to smoking?,"I don't have a count, but I know there are I know there are certainly some."
"Well, there's less than 20, isn't there?","Again, I don't know what the count is."
"Well, isn't the count of the 7,000, it would be less than 20 of all the research funded by the CTR had anything to do with attempting to relate human disease to smoking; isn't that true, Doctor?","I don't know that that's true, no."
Did you look into it?,Have I looked into that specific question? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2 9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol o http://www.veritext.com
Yes.,"I have not, no. (Figlar Exhibit 43, Seligman memo to the CTR file dated November 17, 1978, PT0268, was marked for identification.)"
The next document would be Exhibit 43. It's 2268. Did you review this document in preparation for your deposition today?,
"The next exhibit I'm going to go through with you, Doctor, we can move on is PT030 -- pfc03777, which is Exhibit 47.","Yes, I have it."
And tell the jury what this dooument is.,"It says a Horace R. Kornegay speech, Tobacco Institute annual meeting, January 10th, 1980."
Okay. And will you go to the second page of the speech.,"Yes, sir."
"And you see in the third paragraph down where it says there's been some notable achievements. Can you read that, the -- the first bullet point?",The Surgeon General's media event was preempted by an institute --
"No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If you could start with as a result.","As a result, some notable achievements w^re registered this year. Do you want me to go on?"
Go on. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,Okay.
"Yeah, the bullet points.","The Surgeon General's media event was pte-empted by an Institute first-strike news conference. For the first time in the history of the oigarette controversy, a Secretary of HEW had to share the spotlight. In fact, we won top billing that night on all networks."
"So the -- the tobacco industry was receiving top billing over and above the Surgeon General to get their message out, correct?","Well, it says for the first time in history ever. But I -- I don't know if I can verify whether or not that's true, but that's what they said, the speech."
Do you know how it was the tobacoo industry was able to preempt the Surgeon General media report?,Do I know? Are you asking me how I know?
Yes.,I don't know.
"No, do you. Okay. If you go on to the t^o more pages, you can go not the next page, but the the page after, if you could read the first bullet point? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2179-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",On Page 4?
Yeah.,"Communications have been on the uptrend this year. Our four speakers covered a quarter of a; million miles, logging nearly 800 appearances, including 300 hours on the air. Our new publications unit turned out a dozen new publications and distributed over a quarter of a million copies. The Tobacco Observer has reached a circulation of 86,000. Our films have been seen by about 750,000 people this year -- for a cumulative audience of 3-1/2 million."
"And those are 3-1/2 million people that the tobacco companies are getting their message out to, correct?",
And if you oould go down two more three more bullet points to our contacts with Congress ahd read that.,"Our contacts with Congress, whioh have always been good, are now even better.

"Don't you think that the tobaooo industry was a powerful industry, Dr. Figlar?",
And don't you think that it was important to them to be known by people on Capitol Hill?,
"Well, but but -- but for the average Joe or the average smoker, they didn't have that advantage. They weren't known by anybody on CApitol Hill most likely, right?",
"So just as true today that you are -- you still are known by a lot of people on Capitol Hill, the industry?","No, your general premise of the average man on the street doesn't have the same access as people on the Hill."
"And the next page, if you can go down, where it says in the next few days, if you oould read that paragraph.",The whole paragraph or starting in the middle?
"No. It says in the next few days, just that that two sentences.",Okay. So the middle of that paragraph?
"Yes, sir.","In the next few days the Surgeon General will release yet another report, this time on women and smoking. We have completed a plan for getting our share of the press coverage surrounding this m^dia event."
And what was that press coverage intended t0 do?,I don't know.

On the federal level we intend to improve what Senator Ted Kennedy has described as ""probably the most effective lobby on Capitol Hill.""

Let me stop at this point before I overload you with more good intentions and solemn promises than the 10 presidential candidates we will be hearing so much from in 1980."
"Okay. So when Senator Kennedy -- Kennedy described the tobacoo industry as ""probably the most effective lobby on Capitol Hill,"" do you understand that that was most most likely true?",
"Do you agree that the tobacco industry did h^ve a powerful lobby on tobacco on on Capitol Hill in the '70s -- '50s; '60s, '70s and *^0s? 212-2t9-9424 VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",

And have you seen this dooument before?,I believe I read it in preparation for t iis deposition.
Is that the first time you had seen it?,I don't I don't know I don't know if it was or not. I may have seen it in the Duvall County deposition.
"Okay. And this is a memo from Knopick to Kloepfer, oorreot?",It is.
"And they're both representatives of the Tobacco Institute, oorreot?","I believe this is a TI document, yes."
"And halfway down the first page it says, I've spoken previously with Pollin, currently the h+ad of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; do y4u see that?",I do.
"And it says, we quoted Pollin saying that cigarette smoking is the nation's leading problem among youths despite the rise in marijuana use; do yc u see that?","I do. 0. And then it goes on to say ""cigarette VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c smoking is more addictive than using heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who ever smoke."" Do you see that?"
"Was there any now, this was an internal document, correct?","This is an internal Tobacco Institute document, yes."
"And then on the last page, if you oould read into the reoord the last two sentences, please.",Starting with the lawyers?
"Yes, sir.","The lawyers remind us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a -- a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette oase. We can't defend continued smoking as ""free choice"" if the person was ""addicted."""
"Do you agree with that, Dr. Figlar, that you can't defend smoking as a free choice if the person is truly addicted?",
"As the --as the corporate representative of R. J. Reynolds with the most knowledge of these documents, does R. J. Reynolds agree that they can't defend smoking as a free choice if the person was addicted?",I don't agree with that. I think whether o not you're addicted or not you can still quit.
Do you know what the Surgeon General says about smoking being a free choice if somebody is truly addicted?,Off the top of my head I don't.
You don't remember reading something from the Surgeon General report recently where they comment that smoking is truly not a free choice if somebody is addicted?,"Do I recall that? No, I'm not saying I i haven't been --"
Do you,"read that before, but I haven't heard that. I -- I don't recall that as I sit here."
Do you know how many addicted smokers die every year?,I don't.

"Do you know how many addicted smokers have tried to quit and have quit, but have relapsed?",
"Well, if you don't know that information if you don't know that, why do you say R. J. Reynolds doesn't believe that that smoking is a free choice -- is not a free choice if a person was addicted, if you don't even know the answer to those questions?",
"Well, you just said there's more former smokers than current smokers, oorreot?",That is correct.
Do you know how many of those former smokers were addicted as opposed to being just chippers?,"Well, I have to presume based on the data that I've seen, whioh were people that have quit for longer than a year and who smoked more than just one cigarette in a month, that according to the publio health community a good number of people beoome addicted, so I have to presume that a bunch of those people were addicted smokers."
"Of course, but do you know how many I first want to talk about the people who are not addicted. Of the people who have quit, do you know how many of thoBe people were occasional or social VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Oi o CD http://www.veritext.com smokers?","I will use the publio health data suggestion that what is it, I think 80 percent of people who smoke are addicted, so let's just say percent of the I think it's up to 60 million smokers former smokers would have been not addicted."
You're just speculating. You'd be,"Yeah, I am. But, I mean, you're asking me to speculate."
Are you saying 80 percent of smokers are addicted? Are you saying 80 percent of smokers are addicted?,
"Okay. So that's you're here today as a VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com corporate representative from R. J, Reynolds and you -- you're relying upon information that percent of smokers are addicted to come up with that answer, correct?",
"Okay. And you know you're here as a corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, correct?","I do know that, yes, sir. Q, Okay. So I don't want to talk about the people who continue smoking. I want to talk about the people who quit smoking for a moment, okay?"
"Okay. So we know that there have been tens of millions of Americans who have quit smoking, correct?",
Right.,as we sit here.
"Of that of those 40 million, do you know -- to be included within those people who quit smoking, isn't it true that you had to have had to smoke more than a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime?",
"Okay. So of the 40 million who have quit, do you know how many of them smoked 200 cigarettes in their lifetime as opposed to two packs a day in their lifetime; do you know?",
Do you know of the 40 million who have quit how many of those people actually relapsed after they quit?,"If you look at the data and the data suggests that 89 to 90 percent of the people who are quit, are quit greater than a year, then that would mean that less than 10 percent would have quit for less than that time frame."

On the right hand section do you see the paragraph that begins the fact then?,I do *
"I'm going to read that for you. The fact, then, that the tobacoo data are in agreement with these factors adds considerable weight to the belief that tobacco, especially cigarettes, is of etiologic significance in the production of lung oftnoer.

Will you read the next sentence starting with a number of authorities through facts at the bottom?,"A number of authorities who have examined the same evidence cited by Dr. Burney do not agree with his conclusions. Although the studies reveal a relationship between oigarette smoking and oancer that seems more than coincidental, they do not explain why, even when smoking patterns are the same, oase rates are higher among men than among women and among urban and among rural populations.

And -- and how many years after the Frank Statement was this position put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians?,Probably six.
You referenced in earlier testimony that one of the Surgeon General's reports that you had reviewed discussed the development of criteria for causation and whether or not those criteria had changed over time; do you recall talking about tl at?,"Yes, I do, (Defendant Exhibit D-6, Excerpt from the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Surgeon General's 2000 report, AN-001308, was marked for identification.)"
I want to hand you an excerpt from the Surgeon General's report from the year 2000 whioh is Exhibit D D-6?,
"Dr. Figlar, do you have Exhibit D-6?","Yes, I do."
What is it?,It is a Surgeon General's report from 2000.
"If you'll turn to Page 42 of the report, please. Is there a section in the report titled From Disease Treatment to Risk Management?","There is a section so named, yes."
Okay. And will you read the first paragraph underneath that heading.,"It says, another possible reason for the delayed response to the Surgeon General's report was its less-than-traditional medical perspective. The report's medical researchers were reporting not the kind of traditional clinical data that p^yeiciane were used to encountering in their VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c literature but rather data from epidemiological studies that indicated the risks of smoking. Eventually, such data would be persuasive enough to mark a perceptual shift to, quote, a new kind of numeracy among medical researchers and olinioians alike, but in 1964 most physicians were not prepared to understand muoh less be persuaded by -- the epidemiological data represented in the report, nor to incorporate a public health model into their medical practice."
Can you explain the scientific basis for Reynolds' position on whether smoking had been provon to cause disease in the 1950s and 1960s?,"Yeah, the medical basis would have been mdre traditional. In '64 I think as the Surgeon General in 2000 points out they changed the dynamics somewhat and more relied on on -- on s^ts of data that would allow for the publio health community to react quickly. So but the previous way in which you would develop cause and effect relationships would have -- would have required lines of evidence around mechanistic understanding of the disease formation, definitive causative agents, provide a variety of models that one oould upci and test to the location of the disease, animal VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 o CD CD http://www.veritext.com c c c m* m* models that one could use to reproduce results, so a lot of those things I mentioned earlier on were all part and parcel to how cause and effect relationships were previous prior to 1964 were established. Afterwards it's not exactly the same."
"I showed you several examples of researchers and medical doctors and their positions on whether smoking has been shown to cause disease and that's Exhibits D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5. So my question was: In a general sense are those statements the kinds of statements that Reynolds would have relied on when it would make statements in the Frank Statement about distinguished authorities may disagree with other distinguished authorities on the question of smoking and disease?","That is exactly correct, yes, those are the types of things that they would have relied on, yes."
You talked in in a general sense about the -- the amount of funding and number of articles that were published in the scientific literature based on research sponsored by CTR's grants; do you recall that?,"1 do.

The CTR grant funded projects resulted in more than published scientific or medical articles and reports and many of the CTR grants were co-funded with very prominent U.S. health organisations."

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212490-3430 Cn si O CD CD CD CD http://www.veritext.com As discussed elsewhere in this report, there are many theories about why people smoke, while in most cases the explanation is not simple, nicotine is a generally agreed-upon faotor, Njlcotine has long been considered habitual as hfbitual -- let me start over. Nicotine has long b^en considered as habitual at least and, by some persons, as an addictive drug; do you see that?",I do.
"And the references reference 22, reference 37 and reference 54; do you see those references?",I do.
Will you turn to Page 14-103 of the report ahd will you identify who the authors were of reference 37?,"37 was Knapp, Bliss and Wells Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking, American Journal of Psychiatry, 1963."
Is that the same Knapp and the same title oi the article that we looked at earlier that was funded by the CTR?,It is the same artiole.
And then if you look at reference 54 --,U h - h u h . VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 en o i. CD http://www.veritext.com
Strike that. If you'll turn to Page 15-20 there*8 a section titled Cessation of the Smoking Habit.,"I see that, yes."
"And in the very first sorry -- the second paragraph it says, a number of physiological changes have been observed on withdrawal from tobacco. Decreases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure are observed as early as six hours after withdrawal. Next sentence, these changes persist for at least three days, citing reference and 146, and perhaps for 30, oiting reference 3(7. Is that the same referenoe 37 to the Knapp article that had been sponsored sorry -- funded b^ CTR? A* I believe it is, yes.

"Okay. New topio, Dr. Figlar, I'm going to m >ve to Defendant's Exhibit D-13. This is AS-34, VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com the 1988 Surgeon General's Report. Dr. Figlar, do you have Defendant's Exhibit D-13?","Yes, I do."
The title of that report is Niootine Addiction?,It is.
"If you'll turn to Page 198, please.",Uh-huh.
"In the left-hand column do you see references to researohers Finnegan, Larson, Haag ahd Knapp, Bliss and Wells on that page?",I do.
Were those researohers who were funded by the CTR and TIRC?,They were.
And are they cited in the 1988 Surgeon General's Report?,They are.
What was the conclusion of the Surgeon General's Report with respeot to whether or not nicotine was addictive?,The '88 Surgeon General's Report concluded that nicotine in cigarette smoke was addictive.
"Going back to 1964, what was the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.eom 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.eom lllll I l <>..< < conclusion of the 1964 Surgeon General's Report on the question of whether smoking was addictive?",The 1964 Surgeon General concluded that nicotine was a drug of habituation.
"Do you know whether or not, in addition to these kinds of communications by TI, whether Reynolds put warning labels on its oigarette packs over the years?","They certainly did, yes. (Defendant Exhibit D-23, List of warning labels that appeared on every pack of oigarettes, Dem 30, was marked for identification.)"
"I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Defendant's Exhibit D-23, oigarette warning labels Demonstrative 30.",
"Dr. Figlar, to to your knowledge in addition to -- let me strike that. You discussed earlier in the examination --' you were asked earlier in the examination questions about whether or not the public was confused or misled or failed to understand whether or not smoking was related to li|mg cancer; do you recall that?",Yes. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com MfcewMHMMM y \ c
"Okay. I want to discuss those questions from Mr. Paige in the context of other information that was provided on Reynolds cigarette packs over the years, okay?",Okay.
"If you'll look at Exhibit D-23, what is Exhibit D-23?",D-23 is a list of all the warning labels that would appear on every pack of cigarettes and the various warnings that appeared from 1966 to the present. There was a series of warnings that -- that appeared on every pack.
Would information that's on a cigarette p^ok have been information that consumers of cigarettes were exposed to from 1966 to the present?,"Well, I should think so, yes."
If you'll look at -- will you read the warning that was on oigarette packs from 1966 to 1^70?,It said caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.
Will you read the warning from 1970?,"The 1970 warning said, warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette 212-2?9-9424 VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c smoking is dangerous to your health."

I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit D-22. Let me ask two follow-up questions before we get there.,"I do,"
What is Exhibit D-22?,It's the 1989 Surgeon General's Report Y^ars of Progress.
If you'll turn to Roman numeral little iii in the preface. (Off-the-reoord conference.),
"On the right-hand column the last full paragraph says, during the quarter century that has elapsed since that Report, referring back to the report, individual citizens, private organizations, public agencies and elected officials have tirelessly pursued the Advisory Committee's call for ""appropriate remedial action."" Do you see that?",I do.
"Early on, the U.S. Congress adopted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of and the Publio Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969. Next sentence, these laws recruired a health VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.verltext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.verltext.com warning on oigarette packages, banned cigarette advertising in the broadcast media, and called for ah annual report on the health consequences of smoking; do you see that?",I do.
Were the warnings that are on Exhibit D-23 the warnings that were mandated by Congress?,They are.
Did Reynolds comply with that congressional law and put the cigarette warning libels on all its oigarette packs and advertising?,They did.
"If a smoker looked at a Reynolds oigarette advertisement in the '70s and '80s and '90s, would the advertisement have contained the mandated Surgeon General's warning?",Yes.
"And I want you to turn to Page 3 of that, and do you see a section titled Smokers Aware of Warning?",I do.
"And will you read the first sentence after that header, please.",A 1967 report to Congress included a government survey finding that 93 percent of all smokers were fully aware of the warning label on the packages.
"Okay. Done with that. I want to direct your attention baok to D-22, whioh was the Surgeon General's Report.",Uh-huh.
Do you know whether or not this report contains information with respeot to the publio health official's statements about publio awareness of smoking risks?,"It is -- it is included in here, yes."
Is this information that Reynolds would hive been aware of in the 1980s and '90s? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,Certainly.
"If you'll turn to Page 179, please.","Uh-huh. Q* Will you read the very first sentence in the section titled Is Cigarette Smoking Harmful to Smokers in General, question mark."
Is that information Reynolds would have -- wbuld have been aware of in in 1979?,Sure.
"I'm sorry, 1989?","Sure, yes."
"Turning to the next page, do you see Table 2 titled Trends in Public Knowledge About Smoking and Health?","Yes, I do."
And do you see a reference to oigarette smoking is harmful to health (percentage who agree by smoking status)?,I do.
And does Table 2 cite four different United Health -- excuse me -- four different surveys referencing earlier Surgeon Generals * VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com reports?,"Yes, that's what yes, they do."
"And with respeot to all adults, what were the percentage of smokers who agree that smoking could be harmful to health?","The the trend grows from the years. So the years go from 1964, 1966, 1970 and '75, and the ail adults goes from goes 81, 85, 87 and percent of all adults."
"And for current oigarette smokers, how do the trends compare to all adults?","They moved similarly. They go from percent in '64; 78, 79 and 81 percent of current smokers."
So you were shown a number of press releases over time from the 19 starting with the Ftank Statement through the 1970s from TI; do you recall that?,"Sure, yes."
"So during this same time frame, what did the Surgeon General report about the effectiveness of any strategy to cOnfuse smokers?","Well, it wouldn't look like it would be working very well. The awareness of smoking being harmful continues to increase over that -- course VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com of that decade, so I say think the effectiveness would not have been very good."
"Okay. We're done with that document. You were asked some questions about Plaintiff's Exhibit 3289, whioh was the report on the visit to the U.S.A. from the BAT company; do you recall that?",I do.
"I'm going to hand you that dooument. Mr. Paige read a sentence on Page 2 which said, I think with one exoeption (H.S.N. Greene) the individuals whom we met believed that smoking caused lung cancer if by causation we mean any chain of events whioh finally leads to lung cancer; do you see that?",I do.
"I want you to read the first sentence of the third paragraph under the heading, Causation of Lung Canoer to the jury. Starting with Greene.","Greene of Yale still says that his repeated failure to produce caroinoma by implanting lung tissue along with tobacco smoke condensate into the muscles of mioe is conclusive evidence that smoke cannot cause lung cancer. His experiments were not done quantitatively, however, VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.verltext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.verltext.com I and on these grounds alone the conclusion whioh he draws is certainly not justified. 0. After reading this full report in preparation for this deposition, did you find reported in this document that Greene was, in fact, the only person who BAT met with who did not believe that smoking caused lung cancer?"
If you'll look at the itinerary do you see a reference to meeting with a Dr. Hueper?,I do*
"Based on your review of doouments, what was Dr. Hooper's position on whether smoking has been shown to cause cancer in the 1950s?",In the 1950s W. C. Hueper would not have agreed that smoking was a could be definitively linked to lung oancer from a cause and effect perspective.
I want you to look at I don't have the page numbers. I'll give it right back to you. I should have brought an extra copy. On the bottom of Page 3 will you read for the jury what I've highlighted there at the bottom of Page 3 of the exhibit.,"The SAB of TIRC and the group wo met at VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 en O (D (D http://www.veritext.com the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, broadly take the view that causation is likely to be indirect. Several hypothetical means by which this could occur were proposed, but with no experimental evidence to support any of them. Q, Okay."
"Will you read what Mr. Paige wants you to read, please?","Otherwise, we found general acceptance of the view that the most likely means of causation is that tobacco smoke contains oarcinogenio substances present in sufficient quantity to provide lung cancer when acting for a long time in a sensitive individual,"
Okay.,
"New topic, Dr. Figlar. You were asked some questions and shown a couple of press-releases fjj'om the TI about a study in Beagle dogs by VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 cn o ro O) http://www.veritext.com AUerbaoh. Do you recall that?","I do. (Defendant Exhibit D-27, Artiole by James J. Kilpatriok, The Case of the Changing Report on Smoking, was marked for identification.)"
"I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit D-27, This is",
What is Exhibit -- Defendant's Exhibit Df27?,It's a news piece written or an artiole written by James J. Kilpatriok.
And does this newspaper artiole discuss the American Canoer Society and the Tobaooo Institute's debate about the Auerbaoh Beagle dog studies?,"That's what it is about, yes."
"Okay* Will you read the first paragraph, please,","It says a year has passed since tho VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com American Cancer Society called a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria, turned on the floodlights and trumpeted the long-awaited findings of Dr. Oscar Auerbaoh and E. Cuyler Hammond on the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs. It is an appropriate time to take an anniversary look."
"And will you read the second paragraph, please.","It says, in the field of lung oancer research, the Auerbaoh-Hammond paper probably ranked as the most important paper of the year. Surely it was the most publicized. The two investigators had devoted three years to their work. Their study had cost some $750,000, half of it in federal funds. This was understood to be the breakthrough moment the tobaooo industry, the consumer public and the medical profession had been waiting for."
And did the American Cancer Society issue a press release about the Auerbaoh Beagle dog study?,"They did. Yes, they did."
And did the Tobaooo Inst i tute - - we saw ear l ier did they issue their press release about the Auerbaoh Beagle dog study? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,"They did. We looked at that, yes."
"Okay. I want you to move forward in the document, and do you see the paragraph that begins sbme curious things have happened?",I do.
"Okay. Will you read that paragraph, please.","Some curious things have happened. This milestone paper first was offered to the prestigious Mew England Journal of Medicine, where it was rejected by the reason of the Waldorf publicity. Then it was offered to the Journal of the American Medical Association, where it was again rejected, this time on the judgment of of a i reviewing panel that the paper did not meet the Journal's standards. On June 24th the authors read tfieir paper before a session of the AMA in Chioago. Finally, a much revised version of the report made it to publication in the December issues of ""Archives of Environmental Medicine."""
"Dr. Figlar, was the final artiole that was published in -- in the Journal in terms of its findings and conclusions different than the press release that the American Cancer Society had issued about the report a year earlier? ~~ ""~~ VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2)9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",They were indeed. They were different conclusions. The conclusions were not anywhere n^ar as strong and the results didn't bear the same kind of weight that was shown in that large press release at the Waldorf-Astoria a year before.
All right. We're done with that document. Do you know whether or not the United States Surgeon General has evaluated in its reports the question of whether or not these Beagle dog studies are effective animal models for the production of lung cancer?,"They are looked at it. (Defendant Exhibit D-29 1981 Surgeon General's Report, AS-000028, was marked for identification.)"
And is this from 1981?,I believe it is.
"Would you turn to Page 142, please?",Yes.
"Do you see in the section that begins VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com future research approaches, there's a phrase that begins there are no published studies; do you see that?",Whereabouts?
"Let's just start with the top -- at the tOp of that section, animal models; do you see that?",I do.
"Animal models in whioh emphysema has been induced by elastolytio enzymes have been reported by a number of authors, but for reasons that may reflect a combination of faotors combination of factors suoh as the shorter lifespan of animals, the method of smoke exposure and the species resistance, there are no published studies that acceptably show in an animal model that the development of emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking, do you see that?",I do.
"The next sentence, thus, a successful animal model has not been developed in which the relationship of different types of cigarettes to the development of emphysema oan be studied; do you see that?",I do. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com r C c
Then in the next sentence is a reference to Dr. Auerbaoh's Beagle dog studies? dogs,"I believe so. It says, one study in which received smoke directly through ohronio tracheotomies reported development of emphysema."
What does the next sentence say according to the Surgeon General? resu h4md This o6py para,The lesions were not oonolusive and the Its have not been confirmed by others.
"Turn to Page 148, please.","Uh-huh. (Defendant Exhibit D-30, 1982 Surgeon General's Report, AS-000029, was marked for identification.)"
"We're going to skip that. I'm going to you what has been marked as Exhibit D-30. is from the 1982 Surgeon General. It's AS-29. Would you verify that Exhibit D-30 is a of the '82 Surgeon General's Report, please?","It looks to be that, please."
"An if you'll turn to Page 185, please.",Uh-huh.

Will you read what the Surgeon General reports in that paragraph starting with the word invasive.,"Invasive and noninvasive bronohoalveolar tumors developed in several of 78 dogs that were trained to smoke through a tracheotomy and that smoked cigarettes daily for 2-1/2 years. In a gtoup of 24 dogs that smoked nonflltered cigarettes, 2 animals developed early invasive squamous sell oarcinoma in the bronchi. However, this observation has not been repeated so far."
"Dr. Figlar, will you turn back to Exhibit D-2 9, whioh is the '81 Surgeon General's Report.",Uh-huh.
"I want to direct your attention to Page 2*3, please.",Uh-huh.
Do you see a paragraph that begins publio surveys conducted by the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health; do you see that?,"I do, yes. Q, I'm going to read some sentences. Just VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com sua iiWwiiiWWitt*mihiM c c c toll me if I read the statements out of the report properly. These surveys indicated that the belief that cigarette smoking poses health hazards was increasing, not only among the general public but also among persons who continue to smoke. For example, in response to the statement ""Smoking cigarettes is harmful to health,"" in 1964, 81.3 percent of the persons interviewed agreed, and 13.1 percent disagreed, but in 1975, 84,9 percent agreed ahd 11.3 percent disagreed with intermediate figures ooourring in 1970. Do you see that?"
Was this information that Reynolds would have been aware of in 1981 when this report came out?,"Sure, yes."
"Is it the same is this after the time frame -- well, strike that. From from 1964 to 1981, is this the s^me time frame from whioh the exhibits that Mr. Paige showed you that were TI press releases?","Sure, yes."

"Let me ask you a general question and ask you whether you know when a company issues a press release, does that guarantee that the release will be picked up by a news agency?","No, it does not guarantee that."
Did Mr. Paige show you examples of what the news agencies' reporting of the TobaOco Institute's statements would have been in the contemporaneous time as the statements that he showed you?,"Not not not any that I can recall as I sit here, no."
"So as you sit here, do you know whether all or some or none of the press releases that he showed you were picked up by the press and reported in newspapers in this country?","I mean, I haven't -- I haven't seen the evidence of that. I mean, we see the press releases. We know that those records are there, but I haven't seen the reports in a newspaper or a magazine artiole that would indicate that it's in there."
"Dr. Figlar, I asked you some questions earlier about the Plaintiff's Exhibit P23 -- P^3289, excuse me, which was the BAT report on its visit to the United States; do you recall that?",Uh-huh.
"I have gone through the exhibit and highlighted some paragraphs I'd like you to read for the jury, please.

"All right. Will you turn the page until yOu get to the next highlighted section, please, ahd tell me what page it's on. A, Page 3.",
Okay.,"It says, without exception no single individual whom we met was prepared to extrapolate on unambiguously from any single animal test to man.

Okay. Will you turn to the next page with highlighted language and please read.,"It says, the majority of individuals who we met accepted that beyond all reasonable doubt oigarette smoke most probably acts as a direct though very weak carcinogen on the human lung.

You were shown a clip earlier from .that slime program of the Tobaooo Institute's statement about the question of smoking. If a person was watching that news program would they also have been exposed to that information from that publio health researcher?,"Certainly, yes."
"Dr. Figlar, I have one one more document I'd like you to read that was shown to you by Plaintiff's counsel. This was Deposition Exhibit 18, with was PT2527.

I want to show you then *** it's a VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com new exhibit, PT01497 whioh we'll mark as Plaintiff's Exhibit 75 [sic]. And it's a September 7th, 1971 -- it's actually it's a September 7th, 1971, letter, and it says, I'm enclosing for your information it's from the ojiairman of Philip Morris to Joe it's actually t> Joseph Cullman from Horace Kornegay of the Tobaooo Institute; do you see that document?",I do.
"And if you turn the page, he attached a confidential letter from September 3rd or memo from September 3rd, 1971, from William Kloepfer to Horace Kornegay, oorreot?",Okay.
And as the subjeot is the report on meeting at AMA regarding ERF Tobacco Program; do,"I do 0. And oan you read the first paragraph into tljie record, please."
"And Dr. Howard was the AMA executive director at that time, oorreot?","Well, that's what this letter suggests, yes."
"And it's talking about a program regarding smoking and health research program, oorreot?","It -- it is saying that, yes."
"And in the second page, in the last paragraph, if you oould read the first the first sentence to the jury, please.","It's -- the last paragraph, sir?"
"Yeah, the first sentence of that paragraph,","Howard said he regards the program as a g^eat liability that from AMA's view it has only caused further blackening of AMA's image. Q, Do you have an opinion or do you know whether the AMA has stated publicly that they regretted being involved with programs with the tobacco industry up to 1971?"
"Okay. The next document I want to go over with you is D-5, whioh is the American College of Chest Physicians standards that you told the jury at>out from 1960; do you remember that?",I do.
"And, again, you've already told the jury that you thought that the industry was a powerful industry; do you remember we spoke about that?",
And do you know does Dr. Seymour Farber who was the president of the American College of Chest Physicians who issued this statement in 1960/ do you know what his relationship was with the tbbacoo industry at that time?,I don't.
So whether he was giving speeches and getting approval from the tobaooo industry prior to giving speeches?,"I don't know that, no. (Figlar Exhibit 76, Confidential Report Scientific Advisory Board Meeting, May 10-11, 1958, was marked for identification.)

"Okay, Then I want to show you the next exhibit, whioh is Exhibit 76, whioh is a new exhibit, and it's a confidential report from the Scientific Advisory Board meeting May 10th to 11th, 1&58, if Mr. Latham oould hand that to you.",
Okay. So we we were talking about how in cross-examination with Mr. Latham you disoussed aj 1960 standard from the American College of Chest Physicians where Dr. Seymour Farber was the president and submitted a statement; do you remember that?,"I do. 14 Q. And I want to take you baok to a mooting, Exhibit 76, and you have it before you. It's a confidential report from the Scientific Advisory Board meeting May 10th through 11th, 1958, correct?"
And if you can go to the second page and read Number 4 about some of the things they were discussing during their confidential meeting and tell the jury what was disoussed in 1958 at this confidential meeting two years before the the statement was issued by Dr. Farber. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c,"Number 4, it says Dr. Seymour Farber*s suggestions oonoerning an international symposium on lung oancer, to be conducted by the University of California School of Medicine's Medioal Extension, was disoussed. It was approved in principle, but subjeot to considerable delineation ahd further discussion at the next meeting of the board."
Why would Dr. Farber have to get his international symposium of lung oanoer approved by the by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Tobacco Institute Research Committee? Why why would he need to do that?,I don't know necessarily why he would. It wins suggested it just says it was approved in principle but subjeot to further delineation.
"Okay. But what this relationship with Dr. Farber and the Tobaooo Institute Research Committee, was that disclosed in this Exhibit D-5 that you read to the jury about the statement from the American College of Chest Physicians?",I don't know that it was or was not.
"Well, do you see it disclosed in the statement?","No, because this ie it's really just VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 cn ""-J -V- | 1 ^ CD CD http://www.veritext.com T""""~ c c mm SM> the proceedings from a set of meetings, so I don't see it as a as reporting where any funding may ojr may not be coming from."
Okay. And then the next Exhibit D-8 was you disoussed a book by Larson and Haag to the Surgeon General,Uh-huh.
"-- which was dated 1961, oorreot?",Correct.
"And by the way, do you agree that the industry considered Larson and Haag to be people who were providing friendly research to them?","I don't know whether or not that was that is true or not, but I know they were -~ they certainly received funding from TIRC. (Figlar Exhibit 77, Dooument titled The Importanoe of Biological Research dated 2/3/41, PT1955, was marked for identifioation.)"
"Okay. Well, let's go back to February 3rd, 1941, if Mr. Latham -- Latham can give you Exhibit 1955, and we'll mark that as Exhibit 77, and it's a dooument dated February 3rd, 1941, Importanoe of Biological Research.

And you can go to the second page of that dpcument and read the first sentence to the jury.,"I can, but what what is this document again, I'm sorry?"
"It's a document, it's dated February 3rd, 1941. It's talking about the importance of biological research; do you see that?","I mean, I see that title, but who wrote it ahd what is it? That's -- that was my question."
"It will be in evidence by the time your video is played, so I just want to see if you're familiar with some of the statements in the video --in this document. A, Okay.",
"So if you could turn to Page 2 and read the first sentence to the jury, please.","It says, the tobacoo industry is very much in need of some friendly research in this field."
And then if you can go to the next page aijtd read the last paragraph to the jury.,The last paragraph?
Up to -- up to the first sentence of the n*tt page. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 immfmpmmwwmmmm PHMPfMffWtVf Ol o CD http://www.veritext.com c v ^ l r,"As a result of discussions with Mr. Neiley, Dr. Haag was asked nearly a year ago to lbok about for a man having the desired qualifications. He should combine ability and experience with a broad-minded attitude toward the tobacco industry. It was not until reoently that Dr. Haag oould find anyone whom he considered well qualified for the position. He has now recommended Dr. Larson, who is a young physiologist with a good background, experience and a fine personality."
So is that initially how Larson and Haag became involved in the tobaooo industry?,"Well, again, look, I don't I don't know what this paper is. They may have been involved in the 1940s, but, I mean, I'm not sure what this document is."
"Okay. And then D-8, this exhibit, this Larson and Haag manual, do you know how many different articles -~ research articles they provided to the Surgeon General and why they provided so many?","They provided I think summarized and provided abstraots to over 6,000 articles, oompiled research from, starting I think in the 1800s, if my memory is right, up until about 1959 or so.

Right. Isn't it true that the tobaooo industry wanted they wanted this research to be so vague and incomplete and to be irksome to the reader?,"I don't agree with that. I think the Larson, Haag and Silvette manuscript is a full compendium of what was known about tobaooo and cigarettes, the biological effects, the nature of njicotine, et cetera, is in that volume. It's it's really just a pull together and a review of everything that was written about tobaooo up to tfiat point. (Figlar Exhibit 78, Letter dated 5/6/63 to DeBaun Bryant, Esq., was marked for identification.)"
"Okay. I want to play he gave a deposition in December 19th, 1986, where he was the corporate representative for American Tobacco and he discussed the warnings just like you did today. I want to play that video for you and ask you some questions, okay?",Okay.
"All right. If we can play that and we*11 have that as the next exhibit, whioh will be is it 80?","Yeah. You're up to 80, yes, sir."
"Okay. Thank you, Dr. Figlar. (Figlar Exhibit 80, Video of Robert Heimann in a deposition dated 12/19/86, was marked for identification.) (Playing Video.)",
"Cigarettes -- it's currently being I want to show you what's marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 17, whioh is simply a package of Pall Mall oigarettes that's currently being sold. Can you identify that as a package of Pall Mills?","xes, sxr."
And would you read the warning that's placed on that for us please? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t9*9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,Surgeon General's warning: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.
"That is not a warning that is voluntarily placed there by American Tobacoo, is it?","No, it is not."
Would you put that warning there if Congress didn't require it?,No.
"And the reason is simply American disagrees with the warning, doesn't it?",We certainly do.
"You don't think they harm smokers so there's no reason to put any warning on them, do y^u?",We believe our product is not injurious to health.
"As far as you can as far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?",I would use the term misguided.
"If he's misguided, then I take it that y<>ur opinion is he's wrong? A, I'm simply trying to bo polite about it. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",
"Okay. But not being polite about it, in your opinion he's wrong, correct?","Dead wrong. Q, Congress is wrong in requiring these warnings, correct?"
"So, Dr. Figlar, as you sit here today as an R. J. Reynolds' corporate rep in 2014, in sworn testimony, watching the American Tobacoo oorporate r^p who gave sworn testimony in 1986, do you agree with what was being said at that time by Mr. Heimann?",
And you've told the with Mr. Latham you Went through the effectiveness of the warnings and talked about how effective the warnings are; do you remember doing that?,I don't --
"How many people had seen and believed the warnings on the packages of oigarettes, do you remember talking about that?","I remember talking about the awareness of the dangers of oigarette smoking. I don't know if that was directly connected to the warnings, but certainly awareness of the dangers of cigarette smoking."
Okay. And you also talked about the FTC report; do you remember talking about that?,I don't. No.
"Okay. Well, it was in a dooument that he showed you that you read from. You read a document where you mentioned the '67 FTC report. You don't recall that?","I don't -- I don't remember referencing an FTC report. I'm sorry, I don't. I don't remember referencing it. Q, Do you know are you aware -- as a corporato representative for R. J. Roynolde, are VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t 9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com yiou aware and know what the ' 67 FTC report was?"
"All right. All right. Well, I'll show it tj> you. It's Exhibit 81 and it's PT03870 and it's tjie FTC report to Congress in 1967, and it addresses one of those warnings that you talked ahout on the packages of oigarettes. And if you oj>uld look to the second page, and it talks about the effectiveness of oigarette labeling; do you see that?",I do.
"And you can read the highlighted portion oh that page, please, to the jury,","It says, there's virtually no evidence tl|iat the warning statement on oigarette packages h^s any significant effect. Continue? Do you want me to continue? VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com"
Please.,"If oigarette sales are viewed as an index of the effectiveness of the warning statement, one finds that in 1966 more cigarettes were sold than ever before. Even during January and February 1966, the first two months that the warnings the warning appeared on the oigarette packages, oigarette sales were higher than they had been during the same months of the preceding year."
"And then if you oould turn to Page 7, please, and read the highlighted portion which explains this.",Page 7?
Yes.,The failure of the warning statement on packages to have any discernible effect on cigarette consumption is easily explainable. The warning statement on the package alone has proved to be ineffective mainly because few people seem to pay attention to it.
And you can go on. There's another part.,"I'm sorry. The motivations for smoking physiologically, psychologically and sociologically ~- are complex and a mere reminder i o the hafc&rdp on the- oigaretto package cannot VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com compete with the forces that promote oigarette smoking."
And do you know what foroes were promoting oigarette smoking at that time?,"I mean, I would I would presume when they say promotion that they're talking about cigarette promotions and things like that. (Figlar Exhibit 62, 1981 Federal Trade Commission Staff Report on the Cigarette Advertising Investigation, PT03165, was marked for identification.)"
"But Dr. Figlar, these -- these Surgeon General reports and FTC reports and government reports, they were being made available to the tobacoo industry, were they not?",I'm sorry?
"The tobacco industry, the companies, the R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, American Tobacoo, CTR, people like that, those companies, those organizations they had an opportunity to review government reports such as the Surgeon General reports and the FTC report as they were being issued, oorreot?","I'm assuming they would have, yeah."
"Okay. And especially since they were addressing the -- the product that you all were manufacturing, oorreot?",I would think so.
"And if there were something in there that VERITEXT REPOkTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com concerned you, the tobaooo industry certainly oould have changed had every opportunity to change the behavior and help the American public, correct?","All right. It says, while most Amerioans ake generally aware that smoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially smokers, do not know this basic fact. However, even if it is assumed that every consumer is aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence indicates that many consumers do not hive enough information about the health risks of smoking in order to know how dangerous smoking is, lie., what it is, what is the nature and extent of the health risk of smoking. Many consumers also do not know whether the general health risks of smoking have any personal relevance to themselves o^ whether they are among those groups of people VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2+9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com Who may be uniquely vulnerable to these health hazards."
"Okay. And so this is this is talking about the publio awareness in 1981, correct?","This report was in 1981, yes."
"And if you oould read the highlighted portion on Page 10 to the jury, please.","However, even for lung cancer, the most well known health effect, some gaps in consumer knowledge are evident. Thus, approximately percent of those polled do not know that smoking causes cancer. The data also indicate that substantial numbers of consumers seriously misunderstand and underestimate the increased risks of suffering these health problems as a result of smoking, for example, the survey data discussed in Chapter III indicate that over 40 percent of those polls -- polled do not know that smoking caused most (80%) cases of lung cancer and nearly one-quarter of those polled did not even know it causes many crises."
"And if you oould read the highlighted portion from Page 12 to the jury, please.",
"And if you can go to Page 2-3 and read the highlighted portion to the jury, please.","The amount of oigarette advertising in the United States. Cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America. The next portion it s^ys, the National Commission on Smoking and Public Policy reported in 1978 that the tobacoo industry s^ent more on advertising cigarettes in one day than the (then) National Clearinghouse on Smoking ahd Health, the government's primary agency working in the area, spent in one year."
"And, again, since you brought it up, if we o^nild talk a little bit more about the public awareness of the dangers of smoking, if you could r^ad from Page 3-6 into the record, please. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2 9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com",Which portion whioh highlighted portion?
The second -- the second part whioh is many consumers.,"Okay. Many consumers who have heard that the Surgeon General has determined that smoking is dangerous, do not generally know, for example, (a) what diseases are smoking related, (b), what is the generally increased likelihood of suffering from these diseases as the result of smoking, or (c) what effect these diseases have on the likelihood of suffering a premature death."
"When the tobacco industry was reading this FJTC report and worrying about this lack of awareness, what were they doing to help people?",
In 1981?,
"Okay. And if you can go to Page 3-8 and 3-10 and read that into the record, please, Dr. Figlar. ' A. 3-8, knowledge of more information about the health hazards of smoking is relevant to consumers' awareness of whether the health risks associated with smoking have any personal t application to themselves or whether they are among those who are particularly vulnerable to these health hazards. For example, some consumers incorrectly believe that while smoking may be hazardous to others, it is not hazardous to themselves because of the particular type of oigarette they smoke or the amount they smoke. Of particular concern in this group",
"Hold on. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Doctor. I apologize.","Okay. It's in a different section of the paragraph. It says, of particular oonoern in this group are teenagers who are unaware of the potentially addictive nature of oigarette smoking, ahd who, therefore, may be tempted to experiment with smoking."
"And so this was 1981, again, where we're talking about teenagers being unaware of the VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c c c addictive nature of smoking, correct?",That's what this says. I don't know that I would agree that teenagers are unaware. I was certainly a teenager at that time and I was fully aware.
Right. You -- you were fully aware about hbw addictive nicotine was in 1981?,"No, I was aware of certainly the dangers. It says the a w a r e of the potentially addictive nature. It doesn't say is."
"Okay. And if you oould read 3-10, please, Dr. Figlar.","Certainly. Based upon an analysis of all the data reviewed in its entirety, staff has cbnoluded that there appear to be such significant g*ps in consumer knowledge that a substantial portion of the population does not know how dangerous smoking is, or whether the dangers of smoking apply to them, and, therefore, does not hfve an understanding of the health hazards of smoking. More specifically, the data suggests that (a) a large number of consumers do not know what diseases are related to smoking; (b) a substantial number of seriously misunderstood excuse me a substantial number seriously misunderstood [sic] 212-2J9-9424 VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 Ol Go o CD ro http://www.veritext.com and underestimate the extent of the increased risk of suffering these health problems as the result of smoking; (c) many seriously under -- underestimate or are unaware of the severity of these health consequences and the increased risk of premature death from these illnesses; and (d) a significant number of consumers incorrectly do not believe that these health consequences have any personal relevance to themselves."
"Okay. Dr. Figlar, you remember a long time ago we disoussed the Frank Statement in when the tobacco industry said that the publio health was paramount a paramount concern to them? t% * *es*",
"And now you have a report in 1981, almost years later where the government is issuing a report saying people really don't understand all the health hazards of smoking and health, correct?","That's what this report says. I just read ftom you earlier from the Surgeon General, another f<j>rm of the government --"
I'm going to,--a publio health
I'm going to get to that report. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com,"I'm sorry. I'm just trying to explain my answer, that what we have is two sets of plaoes in t e government that are suggesting that the information in the reporting is contradictory. So you have the Surgeon General on the one hand saying awareness is very high and now we're skying from the FTC from Matt Myers who was the program advisor that -- that not enough information ip known."
Okay. This is 1981?,Correct.
"We have another report eight years later in 1989 that I'm going to talk to you about, but my question to you, Dr. Figlar, most respectfully, is i(i 1953 the tobacco industry issued a statement spying the publio health was of paramount concern t<> them, correct?",That is correct.
"And in 1981 when the tobacco industry was reading this report from the FTC and the government, what did they do to help their consumers?",With regard to awareness I'm not sure. Wl|at they did to their products was try to lower the tar and nicotine levels of those products. VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2J9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com
Whioh oontinued to kill their customers?,
"And so if we can go to the next page, 31-11, if you oould read that highlighted portion to the jury, please.","Hold On. The data, projected nationwide, indicates that some Americans still do not even know that smoking is hazardous to health. In 1978, Gallup asked respondents whether they believed smoking was harmful to health. Although 10 % of the sample did not know that smoking had any harmful effects, 17 % of all smokers did not know that smoking is harmful to health, and nearly one out of every four - 24 % - heavy smokers did not k^ow this fact. In the 1978 Roper Study, 9% of the total simple, 13% of all smokers, and 20% of two pack or m4>re a day smokers did not know that smoking was hazardous. Given that there are approximately i million smokers in this country, these data suggest that millions of Americans vrho smoke still do not kiiow that smoking is harmful to their health. j VERITEXT REPORTING C O M P A N Y 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c wanted - Is that something the tobacco company did they want there to be millions of Americans smoking who harmful? what"
"But, Dr. Figlar, you you told us that up to 90 percent of smokers are starting by the age of 18, oorreot?",I said up to possibly. I've seen a number of sets of data on that.
"Okay. You know that many you know thnt VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 CD http://www.veritext.com c c c many smokers come from backgrounds where they may be less educated than the scientists at Ri. J. Reynolds, correct?","Quite possibly, yes."
"Do you really want to have a debate with those smokers that 90 percent of teenagers in the uneducated Americans who were smoking, did you want tb have a scientific debate with them about cause a^d effect of smoking and cancer?",
"No, but you're talking about 54 million smokers and 400,000 who are dying every year, correct?","That's current data, but yes, I would I would say that would be true."
And if we can go to this again is in 1$81. If you oould read from 3-40 into the record.,"Addiction, that's the section, further VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2t9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-343( ) Ol ro http://www.veritext.com I * * i l l i W I I ' l down the indicate smoking skoking the Surg being aa paragraph it says, evidence from Roper s that the majority of people do not think is addictive.

Correct. So this * so the majority of,.. people would have thought the same way that the Surgeon Addison General thought at that time. Right. And in this there was a memo from Yeaman saying that nicotine is an addiotive dpug, correct? B^rown & pJLease. that you i record?"
"And finally, Dootor, I apologise, I appreciate your patience, if you oould read 4-10 to the jury, please.","For four basics reasons, described in detail below, the current warning is not accessible, and therefore, not cannot be effective. They are: (1) the current warning is overexposed and worn out; (2) the current warning is no longer novel and presents no new information; (fc) the abstract nature of the current warning current warning is not likely to be perceived as personally relevant. In contrast to the current warning, cigarette advertisements present positive VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2f 9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com information about smoking in a highly effective manner.

"Okay. So, Doctor, in addition to what you ti>ld the jury on cross about warnings and publio awareness there was more information in the 1967, the and the 1981 FTC reports as well as the Surgeon General report, oorreot?","I'm sorry?

"On 223 can you read that that that highlighted portion, please.","Sure. Although empirical evidence is sparse, tobaooo industry activities in the form of advertising and promotion, publio relations, and lobbying may interfere with publio beliefs and personalized acceptance of the health risks of smoking.

"And it goes on to say and it goes on to say, the tobaooo industry activities in the form of advertising promotion, publio relations, whioh we disoussed earlier, and lobbying, whioh we disoussed earlier, may interfere with publio beliefs and personalized acceptance of the health risks of smoking, correct?","That is what it says. It says, it may interfere, but that evidence is sparse, that's correct, yes."
"Is that what the tobaooo industry was trying to do, interfere with the publio belief? Were you trying to do that?",
"And then it says, many persons may be vulnerable to information that attempts to oast dt>ubt on these relationships, oorreot?","It says that, yes."
"And so when you --: when the tobaooo industry learned that or read this in the sjirgeon General Report, did they oome forward to tjie publio and apologise for all those statements wnere they were trying to oast doubt on the health effects or the relationship between smoking and cancer?",
"They kept doing it, right?",
"Right, for another 11 years, right?",Approximately.
"While 400,000 Americans were dying each year, correct?",
How did that make you feel?,
"Okay. But what about the 20 million Ajmerioans who have died, what are you doing about that?",
What about the,"I'm trying to do,"
"people who have already died? Dr. Figlar, I'm talking about the 20 million who have already died that ooourred during this years when all this was happening. As the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, how do yOu feel about the 20 million who died?",
"So you appreciate all the suffering that's been caused to all these families then, don't you?",
"Your grandparents aren't here today to tell us that. That's you telling us that that's what your grandparents felt, right, as as a cigarette manufacturer representative, that's what you want us to believe, right?",
"They were telling the American publio that ere was no proof that smoking caused lung oancer, ren't they?",They would say that there was no proof of cause and effect relationship.
While they were,
"Okay. Dr. Figlar, if you oould look at Dh22.",Okay.
And we were talking about the human suffering caused by your the the product. If yj>u oould read into the record the -- it's on Roman numeral ii before the preface.,Okay.
"And if you oould read the third paragraph d^>wn into the record, please.","For now, however, we must recognize that continued tobaooo exposure in the population will ciuse a great deal of human suffering for many decades. Thus, we must not rest upon the laurels o$ the past quarter century. As long as ohildren aijid adolescents continue to find reasons to use VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 MUMWVMMMm* o CD Cn http://www.veritext.com tobacco, replacements will be recruited for at least some of the smokers who quit or who die prematurely. If current trends continue, these replacements will be found disproportionately among minority groups, among the less educated, among the mbst economically disadvantaged, and among women."
"Doctor, as the maker of oigarettes, do you agree that we must recognize that continued tobacco exposure in our population will continue to cause a great deal of suffering for many decades?",
"And if you oould turn the page, and there's a section that says ohildren and a^ole.oents; do you .. that?",I do.
"And if you could read the second paragraph where it says research, through the next paragraph, and then I will probably have one more question.","I'm sorry. The seoond paragraph says, if VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com the it starts with if the adult rate"
Okay. You can start from there. That's fplne. Go ahead. Read those two paragraphs.,"It says, if the adult rate of smoking were tp continue at the present level, the impact of smoking on the future health and welfare of today's ohildren would be enormous. Research has shown that one-fourth or more of all regular cigarette smokers die of smoking-related diseases. If ra-Lllion of the 70 million children now living in the United States smoked oigarettes as adults, about"
"And, Doctor, the last paragraph of that page says that these two factors refute the argument that smoking is a matter of free choice. Most smokers start as teenagers and then become addicted, correct?",That's what it says.
"All right. Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your time.",
"Dr. Figlar, stay, on the same exhibit. I want to have you read two more things on on Page Roman numeral iv. It's right before what you were just reading.",Okay.
I'm going to do you see on the left-hand column there is a sentence that begins the anti-smoking campaign?,"It does, yes."
"Did the '89 Surgeon General's Report report that, quote, the anti-smoking campaign has been a major public health success. Those who have participated in the campaign can take tremendous pride in the progress that has been mad; do you VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424 www.veritext.com 212-490-3430 http://www.veritext.com c N..** c see biiftbf",Yes.
"And then right above it, do you see a sentence that begins within?","Yes,"
"Does the Surgeon General also report in 1&89, within this evolving social milieu, the papulation has been giving up smoking in increasing numbers. Nearly half of all living adults who ever smoked have quit; do you see that? *\.",
Were these statements written after the 1^81 FTC report that you were shown by Mr. Paige? t% x e s .,"Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers arciNrJMfdtW ea exftfriMMtt *kh mice mm gtvta i eMwvoifo hjf eocttrt ec pfcwmwMl maftwef# leNWH npWffM 11VVWVMIW M M M V M AfamA JfcjiA^mfm fc* a^a^^A fcmA t^JUlAflLT^^^ial ^fc j i^^J I A # tAam^rik* m^mmaamtWl Ati^m^u^w*WhhWlUpt**cln*<rti*iown to* pMMf ejamtfcimd n> eWacd mTgW*o*#s f ifceta * poilmiW pxlJe^^^I^L^fc atmJkimjfal^A ferfdaiJ ^aal i mttrtotimeMMm, .** l l i * * * w a# ftaef mat cfcemtfc *Ml%mei*4 ' ' WHWww\m ^^Fm mm{mm^^ ^m l^flmi **j jwfwlWv ^ W ^ w ^ ^ [ WWP 1f**wMlU^I*4^lbMWfflMm*rUlc* Wt WWw 44 predatd ** aMb m not ty* We a W *m end tfrtjt wtt eoopma* atom* wkh tyaifootle.

W,, Weahington, D. C (202.296*8434) QpTOBBiUl, l?f6 T0OC774 Tobacco Institute Comments on ""Tar"" and Nicotine Washington - The Tobacco Institute today issued the following statement ln| reaponee to inquiries concerning a forthcoming magasins article, and earlier published reports on die subject of ""tar"" and nicotine: c The increasing attention in recent weeks to the subject of ""tar"" and nicotine appears to reflect a conaiderable amount of misunderstanding and confusion about this subject. While some scientists believe that ""tar"" and nicotine are harmful, other scientists do not agree. Wa know of no valid scientific evidence demonatratlng that either ""tar"" or nicotine is responsible for any human illness. Even those who maintain that smoking is harmful have not been able to establish that any particular ingredient in cigarette smoke eauses human dteease. With respect to nicotine, the report on Smoking and Health of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee points out that ""There is no acceptable evidence that prolonged exposure to nicotine creates either dangerous functional change of an objective nature or degenerative disease."" The report goes on to state that nicotine ""probably does not represent a significant health problem. ""yt0** There is no ""tar"" In cigarette smoke, and smoke Is not ""tar."" ""Tar"" la the name givsn to some of the components In smoke tihet can be collected by Moratory techniques. ^ ^ ^ ^ . LPJ>616.0001 en ""Nl o CD O c - 2 - . ' JJC7 , \J The growing emphasis on ""tar"" and nicotine can mielead and con- fuae the public inaofar as it suggests that science has established human health atgniflcamce for ""tar"" and nicotine* At best, such a suggestion is a matter of opinion and guesswork. Former Surgson General Terry said in testimony last ysar before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee: ""While it seems at leaat plausible that cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine may present lesser health hasards, there ia presently no proof that this is so."" Nor is there any scientific proof today that ""tar"" and nicotine has aignificance In terms of human health. Scientists throughout the world are continuing to investigate to learn the full facta about ""tar"" and nicotine, and about questions concern* lng tobacco and health. The tobacco industry ia supporting much of tills research and will continue to do so. 00O00 TIMN 0099041. LP 0616.0002 w *NJ o CD O O) wsc. ft * * f .' > i /***-. c ("
