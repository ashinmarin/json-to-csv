                        "answer": "There are several things that make up the price at retail. The price at retail that a consumer pays includes the margins for the retailer, the margins for the wholesaler, it includes state excise taxes. It includes federal excise taxes. It includes master settlement expenses. It includes employee costs. It includes the leaf and materials to package the product, it includes employee costs, marketing selling, research costs. So there are a lot of expenses, a lot of costs included in the final price that the consumer pays."

But to obtain your license there is an ethics exam, and I elected not to take the ethics exam and then obtain a license. I was no longer in public accounting.

When counsel for Philip Morris asked you about the elements that go into making up the cost of Philip Morris cigarettes at retail, you mentioned margins, which is the same as profit for retailers. You mentioned margins, which is the same as profit for wholesalers. You mentioned excise tax, employee costs and federal excise tax. Do you remember that?",

                        "answer": "Yes. And when I gave that response, I didn't give every single cost and/or margin that goes into the retail price of a pack of cigarettes. So I was giving you examples of those things that made up the as we talked about earlier the average price of a pack not inclu different of cigarettes. Right. One of the elements that you did de in your analysis or your list of the valuations that make up the price of cigarettes sold to people in this country is the profit or true, isn the margin for the manufacturer. And it's 't it, that there is a profit margin for the manufacturer, for Philip Morris, right? Yes. Philip Morris sets the price for their cigarettes taking into account what they believe a consumer maximize their cig will spend in such a way as for them to their profit margin, correct? Could you restate your question, please? Sure. Philip Morris sets the price of arettes in such a way as to determine what they believe reasonable consumers will spend on the product, Morris's payment s, and at the same time maximize their Philip profit margin, true? Generally speaking, yes. Okay. And you talked about settlement and I object to that entire discussion, but I'm going to ask you questions about it without waiving that. You said that they've paid out you know, you said something more than $20 billion and counsel reminded you that it might be upwards of $60 billion; do you remember that?"

DEFENSE COUNSEL: Object to the form.",

And the two parties agreed that in order to settle, there would be this agreement, and then the manufacturers would make these payments, along with other restrictions, that would go on into perpetuity."

Okay. And so, what those states said is, ave a Medicaid program or we're subsidizing -- state funds are subsidizing medical expenses of state residents, right? Okay. That's true, right? Yes. Okay. And the states said: And now we've come to learn, tobacco companies, that we've been spen billions ding billions of dollars hundreds of of dollars -- of state Medicaid funds to pay for medical expenses for completely avoidable diseases that your money. process, right ? product has caused. So you guys owe us That was the allegation, right? Okay. Okay. And then after a litigation the states and the tobacco companies settled, Yes. Okay.
